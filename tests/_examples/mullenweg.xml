<p>I learned something novel about how the ice age happened from this <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-freakishly-strong-base/">Freakishly Strong Base post by Morgan Housel</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The prevailing idea before [Wladimir] Köppen was that ice ages occur when the earth’s tilt supercharges the wrath of cold winters. Köppen showed that wasn’t the case. Instead, moderately cool summers are the culprit.</p><p>It begins when a summer never gets warm enough to melt the previous winter’s snow. The leftover ice base makes it easier for snow to accumulate the following winter, which increases the odds of snow sticking around in the following summer, which attracts even more accumulation the following winter. Perpetual snow reflects more of the sun’s rays, which exacerbates cooling, which brings more snowfall, and on and on.</p><p>You start with a thin layer of snow left over from a cool summer that no one pays much attention to, and after a few tens of thousands of years the entire earth is covered in miles-thick ice.</p></blockquote>



<p>Fascinating! The blog goes on to apply the idea to that strong base, accumulating a bit at a time, to investing and business. The power of compounding seems appropriate to share on <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees">the day Jeff Bezos announced his retirement</a>.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with one of my favorite quotes from Charlie Munger, which is also how the <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-freakishly-strong-base/">article ends</a>: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-default"><blockquote><p>&#8216;The first rule of compounding: never interrupt it unnecessarily.&#8217;</p><cite>Charlie Munger</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><em>The iceberg photo is one <a href="https://ma.tt/2011/08/glacier/">I took near Svalbard in 2011</a>.</em></p>

<p>After you&#8217;ve watched <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/inauguration-day-live-updates/2021/01/20/958743170/poet-amanda-gorman-reads-the-hill-we-climb">the amazing poem from Amanda Gorman</a>, check out the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">new WhiteHouse.gov that re-launched today</a> using WordPress &amp; Gutenberg with a number of cool features including dark mode, text zoom, a totally responsive layout, and a Spanish version of the site. The site is clean, <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1351957829461155849">fast</a>, and accessible. It&#8217;s exciting and an honor that the online home for the Executive branch is on Open Source software, and I&#8217;m proud WordPress can carry the torch that <a href="https://dri.es/whitehouse-gov-using-drupal">Drupal lit in 2009</a>.</p>



<p>Besides Gutenberg, poking around I noticed a HTTP header and HTML comment <a href="https://usds.gov/apply">encouraging people to join USDS</a>, and this great #46 easter egg in the theme file:</p>

<p>Anyone notice any other plugins? I haven&#8217;t spoken to him directly but I&#8217;d be shocked if <a href="https://nacin.com/">Nacin</a> wasn&#8217;t involved with this one. I&#8217;m also curious if any of the WP agencies were involved, it has touches of <a href="https://10up.com/">10up</a> but I don&#8217;t see any mention of it on their site or <a href="https://twitter.com/10up">Twitter</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/HoeflerCo/status/1351984719634771970">Hoefler&amp;Co  credits</a> <a href="https://wideeye.co/">Wide Eye Creative with the design</a>.</p>



<p>I noticed a few people happy that some previous pages and files on the old site were returning 404 errors, like the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/how-trump-administration-s-1776-report-warps-history-racism-slavery-n1254926">controversial 1776 report</a>, but on this I think the webmasters of the United States of America should demand better, since <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs Don&#8217;t Change</a>. Previous websites are <a href="https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/archived-websites">all saved by the National Archives</a>, but there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any sort of norm for automatically redirecting links that went to any subdirectories or addresses under WhiteHouse.gov. </p>



<p>There are WP plugins that could help, like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/">Redirection</a>, but also perhaps the root domain itself could always redirect to a subdomain, like 46.whitehouse.gov, so we&#8217;d have a consistent domain and permalinks for everything, and then each new administration would get a new subdomain.</p>
