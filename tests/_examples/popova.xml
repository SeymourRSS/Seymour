<p>In a testament to Aldous Huxley&#8217;s astute insight that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/03/28/aldous-huxley-art-artists-sincerity-obvious/">&#8220;all great truths are obvious truths but not all obvious truths are great truths,&#8221;</a> the polymathic mathematician <strong>Benoit Mandelbrot</strong> (November 20, 1924&ndash;October 14, 2010) observed in his most famous and most quietly radical sentence that &#8220;clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.&#8221; </p>
<p>An obvious truth a child could tell you. </p>
<p>A great truth that would throw millennia of science into a fitful frenzy, sprung from a mind that dismantled the mansion of mathematics with an outsider&#8217;s tools.</p>

<p>A self-described &#8220;nomad-by-choice&#8221; and &#8220;pioneer-by-necessity,&#8221; Mandelbrot believed that &#8220;the rare scholars who are nomads-by–choice are essential to the intellectual welfare of the settled disciplines.&#8221; He lived the proof with his discovery of a patterned order underlying a great many apparent irregularities in nature &#8212; a sweeping symmetry of nested self-similarities repeated recursively in what may at first read as chaos. </p>
<p>The revolutionary insight he arrived at while studying cotton prices in 1962 became the unremitting vector of revelation a lifetime long and aimed at infinity, beamed with equal power of illumination at everything from the geometry of broccoli florets and tree branches to the behavior of earthquakes and economic markets. </p>

<p>Mandelbrot needed a word for his discovery &#8212; for this staggering new geometry with its dazzling shapes and its dazzling perturbations of the basic intuitions of the human mind, this elegy for order composed in the new mathematical language of chaos. One winter afternoon in his early fifties, leafing through his son&#8217;s Latin dictionary, he paused at <em>fractus</em> &#8212; the adjective from the verb <em>frangere</em>, &#8220;to break.&#8221; Having survived his own early life as a Jewish refugee in Europe by metabolizing languages &#8212; his native Lithuanian, then French when his family fled to France, then English as he began his life in science &#8212; he recognized immediately the word&#8217;s echoes in the English <em>fracture</em> and <em>fraction</em>, concepts that resonated with the nature of his jagged self-replicating geometries. Out of the dead language of classical science he sculpted the vocabulary of a new sensemaking model for the living world. The word <em>fractal</em> was born &#8212; binominal and bilingual, both adjective and noun, the same in English and in French &#8212; and all the universe was new.</p>
<p>In his essay for artist Katie Holten&#8217;s lovely anthology of art and science, <a href="https://www.katieholten.com/abouttrees" target=_"blank"><strong><em>About Trees</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/about-trees/oclc/916721640&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; trees being perhaps the most tangible and most enchanting manifestation of fractals in nature &#8212; the poetic science historian James Gleick reflects on Mandelbrot&#8217;s titanic legacy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mandelbrot created nothing less than a new geometry, to stand side by side with Euclid&#8217;s &#8212; a geometry to mirror not the ideal forms of thought but the real complexity of nature. He was a mathematician who was never welcomed into the fraternity&#8230; and he pretended that was fine with him&#8230; In various incarnations he taught physiology and economics. He was a nonphysicist who won the Wolf Prize in physics. The labels didn&#8217;t matter. He turns out to have belonged to the select handful of twentieth century scientists who upended, as if by flipping a switch, the way we see the world we live in.</p>
<p>He was the one who let us appreciate chaos in all its glory, the noisy, the wayward and the freakish, form the very small to the very large. He gave the new field of study he invented a fittingly recondite name: &#8220;fractal geometry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It was Gleick who, in his epoch-making 1980 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Making-Science-James-Gleick/dp/0749386061/?tag=braipick-20" target=_"blank"><strong><em>Chaos: The Making of a New Science</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/chaos-making-a-new-science/oclc/934221969&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>), did for the notion of fractals what Rachel Carson <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/01/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-dorothy-freeman/">did for the notion of ecology</a>, embedding it in the popular imagination both as a scientific concept and as a sensemaking mechanism for reality, lush with material for metaphors that now live in every copse of culture. </p>

<p>He writes of Mandelbrot&#8217;s breakthrough:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over and over again, the world displays a regular irregularity.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>In the mind&#8217;s eye, a fractal is a way of seeing infinity. </p>
<p>Imagine a triangle, each of its sides one foot long. Now imagine a certain transformation &#8212; a particular, well-defined, easily repeated set of rules. Take the middle one-third of each side and attach a new triangle, identical in shape but one-third the size. The result is a star of David. Instead of three one-foot segments, the outline of this shape is now twelve four-inch segments. Instead of three points, there are six.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you incline toward infinity and repeat this transformation over and over, adhering smaller and smaller triangles onto smaller and smaller sides, the shape becomes more and more detailed, looking more and more like the contour of an intricate perfect snowflake &#8212; but one with astonishing and mesmerizing features: a continuous contour that never intersects itself as its length increases with each recursive addition while the area bounded by it remains almost unchanged. </p>

<p>If the curve were ironed out into a straight Euclidean line, its vector would reach toward the edge of the universe. </p>
<p>It thrills and troubles the mind to bend itself around this concept. Fractals disquieted even mathematicians. But they described a dizzying array of objects and phenomena in the real world, from clouds to capital to cauliflower. </p>

<p>It took an unusual mind shaped by unusual experience &#8212; a common experience navigated by uncommon pathways &#8212; to arrive at this strange revolution. Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Benoit Mandelbrot is best understood as a refugee. He was born in Warsaw in 1924 to a Lithuanian Jewish family, his father a clothing wholesaler, his mother a dentist. Alert to geopolitical reality, the family moved to Paris in 1936, drawn in part by the presence of Mandelbrot’s uncle, Szolem Mandelbrojt, a mathematician. When the war came, the family stayed just ahead of the Nazis once again, abandoning everything but a few suitcases and joining the stream of refugees who clogged the roads south from Paris. They finally reached the town of Tulle. </p>
<p>For a while Benoit went around as an apprentice toolmaker, dangerously conspicuous by his height and his educated background. It was a time of unforgettable sights and fears, yet later he recalled little personal hardship, remembering instead the times he was befriended in Tulle and elsewhere by schoolteachers, some of them distinguished scholars, themselves stranded by the war. In all, his schooling was irregular and discontinuous. He claimed never to have learned the alphabet or, more significantly, multiplication tables past the fives. Still, he had a gift. </p>
<p>When Paris was liberated, he took and passed the month-long oral and written admissions examination for École Normale and École Polytechnique, despite his lack of preparation. Among other elements, the test had a vestigial examination in drawing, and Mandelbrot discovered a latent facility for copying the Venus de Milo. On the mathematical sections of the test &#8212; exercises in formal algebra and integrated analysis &#8212; he managed to hide his lack of training with the help of his geometrical intuition. He had realized that, given an analytic problem, he could almost always think of it in terms of some shape in his mind. Given a shape, he could find ways of transforming it, altering its symmetries, making it more harmonious. Often his transformations led directly to a solution of the analogous problem. In physics and chemistry, where he could not apply geometry, he got poor grades. But in mathematics, questions he could never have answered using proper techniques melted away in the face of his manipulations of shapes.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the heart of Mandelbrot&#8217;s mathematical revolution, this exquisite plaything of the mind, is the idea of self-similarity &#8212; a fractal curve looks exactly the same as you zoom all the way out and all the way in, across all available scales of magnification. Gleick descirbes the nested recursion of self-similarity as &#8220;symmetry across scale,&#8221; &#8220;pattern inside of a pattern.&#8221; In his altogether splendid <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Making-Science-James-Gleick/dp/0749386061/?tag=braipick-20" target=_"blank"><strong><em>Chaos</em></strong></a>, he goes on to elucidate how the Mandelbrot set, considered by many the most complex object in mathematics, became &#8220;a kind of public emblem for chaos,&#8221; confounding our most elemental ideas about simplicity and complexity, and sculpting from that pliant confusion a whole new model of the world.</p>

<p>Inspired by the landmark locus of courage and resistance at Standing Rock &#8212; the 2016 movement that magnetized people from more than five hundred indigenous nations and thousands of allies to take a stance against the Dakota Access Pipeline, against its concrete assault on a particular piece of land and against its general symbolism as ominous emblem of extractionism &#8212; the book invites young people to cast themselves as agents of change and stewards of the natural world. </p>

<p>In the author&#8217;s afterword, Lindstrom explains that in Ojibwe culture, women are considered the protectors of the water and men of the fire. In her tradition, there is a prophecy that paints two possible roads from the present to the future: One is the natural path, embracing the sacred relationship between human beings and the rest of the natural world long before biologists and ecologists discovered that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/07/07/the-spell-of-the-sensuous-david-abram/">&#8220;we are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human&#8221;</a>; the other is a path of unnatural acceleration, propelled by greed and mindless technological frenzy. </p>

<p>In the prophecy, this second path is strewn with black snakes &#8212; a symbolic image ominously reflected in the actuality of the oil pipelines that cross-hatch Native lands with their grim message of turning nature from a source of life-wide vitality and reverence to a resource for human need and greed. </p>

<p>Radiating from the spirit of the story is a reflection of the <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/04/12/rachel-carson-scripps-college-commencement/">touching message to the next generations</a>, with which Rachel Carson said her farewell to life after awakening the ecological conscience of the American mainstream: </p>
<blockquote><p>Yours is a grave and sobering responsibility, but it is also a shining opportunity. You go out into a world where mankind is challenged, as it has never been challenged before, to prove its maturity and its mastery &#8212; not of nature, but of itself.</p></blockquote>

For this is the prize,&#8221; Toni Morrison wrote in an exquisite passage from <em>Beloved</em> as she considered <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/01/03/toni-morrison-beloved-heart/">the body as an instrument of sanity, joy, and self-respect</a> a century after William James asserted in his groundbreaking work on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/11/what-is-an-emotion-william-james/">how our bodies affect our feelings</a> that &#8220;a purely disembodied human emotion is a nonentity,&#8221; lending the fledgling credibility of a young science to Walt Whitman&#8217;s poetic insistence that &#8220;the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern and includes and is the soul.&#8221; </p>
<p>There is such fertile ground for sensemaking in <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/01/02/the-snail-with-the-right-heart/">this space between biology and metaphor</a> that we have always used our bodies as sensemaking instruments for the soul. But no part of the body has taken on more metaphorical meaning than the vital organ depicted in millennia of literature and song as the seat of love. </p>

<p>When we speak of the heart breaking, we are speaking metaphorically, and yet anyone who has lived through heartbreak &#8212; that is, anyone who has lived at all &#8212; knows intimately the awful way in which the psychological condition of loss takes on the quality of physical pain. It is hardly surprising, then, that the body and the soul <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/20/the-body-keeps-the-score-van-der-kolk/">heal in consanguinity</a> &#8212; the heart-as-metaphor heals the same way the heart-as-organ does.</p>
<p>That is what English poet <a href="https://www.christyducker.co.uk/" target="_blank">Christy Ducker</a> explores with uncommon sensitivity and lyric splendor in &#8220;A Scientist&#8217;s Advice on Healing.&#8221; A fine poet and a fine scholar who earned her Ph.D. while composing <a href="https://www.christyducker.co.uk/poems/" target="_blank">poems</a> about the Victorian lighthouse keeper Grace Darling, Ducker embodies the animating spirit of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/the-universe-in-verse/"><em>The Universe in Verse</em></a> and stands as a testament to Ursula K. Le Guin&#8217;s lovely insistence that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/10/ursula-k-le-guin-late-in-the-day-science-poetry/">&#8220;science describes accurately from outside, poetry describes accurately from inside, [and] both celebrate what they describe.&#8221;</a> </p>
<p>In this enchanting animated poem, Ducker joins visions with artist <a href="https://thumbprod.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Kate Sweeney</a> to deliver a soulful prescription partway between science and metaphor, between organ and instrument, as palliating to the physiology of illness as it is to the psychology of heartbreak: </p>

<blockquote><p><strong>A SCIENTIST&#8217;S ADVICE ON HEALING</strong><br />
<em>by Christy Ducker</em></p>
<p>Try to accept<br />
this fat red hurt<br />
is your starting point,<br />
in the way a pen must be put to paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in one particular spot,</p>
<p>then move</p>
<p>beyond<br />
the globby flap<br />
of blame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and past<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mono-sulk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of pain.</p>
<p>Change the subject,<br />
before it&#8217;s too late.<br />
Sketch out<br />
what health<br />
you do possess,<br />
what signal-cascades,<br />
what flotilla of cells<br />
circumnavigate you,</p>
<p>then draw yourself back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together again,<br />
in a language<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of your own.</p>
<p>Your body&#8217;s talk<br />
is loose as lymph &#8212;<br />
it&#8217;ll have you open out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a tree,<br />
or sneak up on pain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as assassin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sidekick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or wolf.</p>
<p>Encourage this<br />
for healing won&#8217;t come at you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;straight.<br />
Embrace the lack of heroics &#8212;<br />
this isn&#8217;t Hollywood,<br />
it&#8217;s you,<br />
in a plot<br />
that may<br />
or may not resolve.</p></blockquote>

<p>During his long recovery from paralytic polio as a child, William had fallen in love with the natural world, escaping his confinement through books about the wilderness and its wondrous creatures. A century before the Oxford Children&#8217;s Dictionary <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/17/the-lost-words-macfarlane-morris/">discarded dozens of words related to nature</a> as irrelevant to the imagination and its prosthesis in language, the small bedridden boy grew especially enchanted by the feathered creatures of free flight that he met on the page. </p>
<figure  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/17/the-lost-words-macfarlane-morris/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/thelostwords7.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Art by Jackie Morris from <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/17/the-lost-words-macfarlane-morris/"><em>The Lost Words</em></a> by Robert Macfarlane</figcaption></figure>
<p>Literature remained his portal into life as he set out on a literary career in New York. But nature beckoned, the birds beckoned. </p>
<p>At thirty, Vogt abruptly left the city for Latin America, traveling on a Peruvian commission to study bird populations on the guano islands. In the three years he spent there, laboring in the salty air on the hot barren rocks, he arrived at an empirical proof of Muir&#8217;s insight &#8212; Vogt discovered that when changes in ocean currents diminished the population of plankton and anchovies, millions of birds fled the islands in search of food, leaving their defenseless chicks to die in &#8220;pitiful, collapsed, downy clumps&#8221; that broke his heart. </p>
<p>He saw in this heartbreak a miniature of the whole &#8212; the intricate interlacing of creaturely destinies on a planet of finite resources, growing populations, and infinite interconnectedness of needs. </p>
<figure  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/05/if-you-come-to-earth-sophie-blackall/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE.Birds_.2000.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Art from <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/05/if-you-come-to-earth-sophie-blackall/"><em>If You Come to Earth</em></a> by Sophie Blackall</figcaption></figure>
<p>Vogt spent the next decade and a half developing these ideas by devouring countless books and scientific papers, talking with scientists and sea captains, farmers and diplomats, presidents and sheepherders in Patagonia, engineers and trappers in Manitoba. In 1948 &#8212; the year the great nature writer Henry Beston cast his poetic hope that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/01/henry-beston-northern-farm-human-nature/">&#8220;perhaps there is still time to take a stand for the Kingdom of Life [which] needs defenders&#8221;</a> and that &#8220;perhaps, mighty as its enemies may be, allies will come who are even mightier” &#8212; Vogt distilled his learnings in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Road-Survival-William-Vogt/dp/1166135950/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Road to Survival</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/road-to-survival/oclc/1057726082&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>), a mighty manifesto that roused a generation of allies to stand for the Kingdom of Life. </p>
<p>At the crux of his inquiry into the key motive forces of our civilization&#8217;s course is Vogt&#8217;s insistence that while much is broken with the exploitive consumerism behind the world&#8217;s government and industry, much more depends on and is mendable by the concerted collective action of ordinary people. In a humbling testament to the slow work of cultural change and civilizational course-correction, it would take nearly a century for his ideas to come alive and actionable in such pillars of ecological responsibility as the Paris Agreement, the Green New Deal, and Greta Thunberg&#8217;s global school climate strike movement. </p>

<p>In an era when humanity regarded the rest of nature as <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/10/america-ferrera-sojourns-in-the-parallel-world-denise-levertov/">a world parallel to our own</a> &#8212; a world at best visited in pleasant excursions, at worst reduced to extractable resources to serve human needs &#8212; Vogt insists that &#8220;ecological health is one of the indispensables&#8221; in the &#8220;flowering of human happiness and well-being.&#8221; A century after Ernst Haeckel <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/03/26/ernst-haeckel-medusae/">coined the term <em>ecology</em></a> and a decade before Rachel Carson <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/01/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-dorothy-freeman/">made it a household word</a>, Vogt draws on his island discovery to contour the totality of Earth&#8217;s ecological interdependence:</p>
<blockquote><p>Drastic measures are inescapable. Above everything else, we must reorganize our thinking. If we are to escape the crash we must abandon all thought of living unto ourselves. We form an earth-company, and the lot of the Indiana farmer can no longer be isolated from that of the Bantu&#8230; An eroding hillside in Mexico or Yugoslavia affects the living standard and probability of survival of the American people&#8230; Today&#8217;s white bread may force a break in the levees, and flood New Orleans next spring. This year&#8217;s wheat from Australia&#8217;s eroding slopes may flare into a Japanese war three decades hence.</p></blockquote>
<figure  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/05/if-you-come-to-earth-sophie-blackall/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE.weather.2000.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Art from <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/05/if-you-come-to-earth-sophie-blackall/"><em>If You Come to Earth</em></a> by Sophie Blackall</figcaption></figure>
<p>Rising from the wakeful pages is the assurance, at once empowering and disquieting with its weight of responsibility, that &#8220;we the people&#8221; is not some agglomeration of abstract others but the sum total of each and every one of us as individual and concrete agents of change. </p>
<p>In a chapter aptly titled &#8220;History of Our Future,&#8221; Vogt writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I write &#8220;we&#8221; I do not mean the other fellow. I mean every person who reads a newspaper printed on pulp from vanishing forests. I mean every man and woman who eats a meal drawn from steadily shrinking lands. Everyone who flushes a toilet, and thereby pollutes a river, wastes fertile organic matter and helps to lower a water table. Everyone who puts on a wool garment derived from overgrazed ranges that have been cut by the little hoofs and gullied by the rains, sending runoff and topsoil into the rivers downstream, flooding cities hundreds of miles away.</p></blockquote>
<p>Writing shortly before he became National Director of Planned Parenthood &#8212; a position he would hold for more than a decade in parallel with his conservation work &#8212; Vogt adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Especially do I mean men and women in overpopulated countries who produce excessive numbers of children who, unhappily, cannot escape their fate as hostages to the forces of misery and disaster that lower upon the horizon of our future.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The direction of these curves and the misery they write across the earth are not likely to be changed in the proximate future. Their direction is fixed for some decades. Great masses of people have a preponderantly young population; as they come into the breeding age we must, despite all possible efforts short of generalized slaughter, expect human numbers to increase for a time. The drag imposed by ignorance, selfishness, nationalism, custom, etc., is certain to retard, by some decades, any effective or substantial improvement of resource management.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an admonition of astonishing prescience, Vogt insists that changing the trend requires revising our past ideals to calibrate them to an evolving ecological reality:</p>
<blockquote><p>The freebooting, rugged individualist, whose vigor, imagination, and courage contributed so much of good to the building of our country (along with the bad), we must now recognize, where his activities destroy resources, as the Enemy of the People he has become&#8230; Above all, we must learn to know &#8212; to feel to the core of our beings &#8212; our dependence upon the earth and the riches with which it sustains us. We can no longer believe valid our assumption that we live in independence.</p></blockquote>

<p>Writing shortly before Rachel Carson penned her prescient open letter to America, insisting that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/02/08/rachel-carson-washington-post-letter-1953/">&#8220;the real wealth of the Nation lies in the resources of the earth &#8212; soil, water, forests, minerals, and wildlife,&#8221;</a> Vogt calls for long-term thinking and broad-range feeling:</p>
<blockquote><p>We must &#8212; all of us, men, women, and children &#8212; reorient ourselves with relation to the world in which we live&#8230; We must come to understand our past, our history, in terms of the soil and water and forests and grasses that have made it what it is. We must see the years to come in the frame that makes space and time one.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a world he considered already overcrowded and resource-strained by the two billion people inhabiting it &#8212; a population that would triple within a generation &#8212; Vogt adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we are crowded together&#8230; on the shrinking surface of the globe, we have set in motion historical forces that are directed by our total environment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Half a century after Alfred Russel Wallace issued his <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/11/the-wonderful-century-alfred-russel-wallace/">prophetic prescription for civilizational course-correction</a> &#8212; an admonition that fell on deaf ears at the outset of the twentieth century and would remain a point of willful deafness in the climate denial of the twenty-first &#8212; Vogt makes an impassioned and empowering appeal to the only substantive force of change in the grand scheme of any society and civilization:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we ourselves do not govern our destiny, firmly and courageously, no one is going to do it for us. To regain ecological freedom for our civilization will be a heavy task. It will frequently require arduous and uncomfortable measures. It will cost considerable sums of money. Democratic governments are not likely to set forth on such a steep and rocky path unless people lead the way.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>So that the people shall not delude themselves, find further frustration through quack nostrums, fight their way into blind alleys, it is imperative that this world-wide dilemma be made known to all mankind. The human race is caught in a situation as concrete as a pair of shoes two sizes too small. We must understand that, and stop blaming economic systems, the weather, bad luck, or callous saints. This is the beginning of wisdom, and the first step on the long road back.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The story of a forgotten visionary suspended between science and spiritual yearning, who inspired Kant and anticipated Hubble.</h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>Thomas Wright</strong> (September 22, 1711&ndash;February 25, 1786) grew up with a passion for learning and a speech impediment that made the rural English schoolroom a gauntlet. When he set about educating himself at home, his father declared the boy mad for his mathematical passions and burned all the books his mother had bought him. Undeterred, Thomas found a mathematics tutor in a local astronomer, took free science classes at a local parish, then apprenticed himself to a London instrument-maker, falling deeper and deeper in love with astronomy and the quest for elemental truth. By nineteen, he had established a school of his own to teach mathematics and navigation. He would go on to build an observatory, describe the spiral shape of the Milky Way for the first time, declare himself &#8220;an enemy to the taking of any thing for granted, merely because a person of reputed judgment has been heard to say it absolutely is so,&#8221; and become the first person to suggest that there are galaxies other than our own, nearly two centuries before Hubble <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/01/24/the-boy-whose-head-was-filled-with-stars-edwin-hubble/">staggered our understanding of the universe with the empirical proof</a>.</p>

<p>In 1750, Wright self-published his visionary and verbosely titled book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Original-Hypothesis-Universe-Cambridge-Collection/dp/1108073743/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe, Founded upon the Laws of Nature, and Solving by Mathematical Principles the General Phaenomena of the Visible Creation, and Particularly the Via Lactea</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://archive.org/details/TO0E080257_TO0324_PNI-12461_000000/page/116/mode/2up" target="_blank"><em>public domain</em></a>). With his keen aesthetic sensibility &#8212; he was also an architect and garden designer &#8212; he commissioned &#8220;the best masters&#8221; to illustrate his theories in thirty-some scrumptious plates populated by comets, planets, and other celestial splendors observed and conjectured. </p>

<p>Only 118 copies of the book were printed, all for Wright&#8217;s patrons and private subscribers. (A delight to think that a long-ago astronomer sustained his work <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/donate/">the way I do</a>.) One eventually reached Immanuel Kant, who was especially captivated by Wright&#8217;s explanation of why the Milky Way appears to us the way it does &#8212; an optical effect owing to our particular position within the plane of the galaxy &#8212; and by the notion of multiple galaxies. Kant seized upon these ideas and developed them in a book he published anonymously five years later, drawing on Wright&#8217;s theories to conceive of his famous &#8220;island universes,&#8221; which went on to influence generations of astronomers all the way through Hubble and his epoch-making observational proof. </p>
<p>As Kant&#8217;s authorship was discovered, his celebrity subsumed these theories, which came to be attributed to him. Wright and his book fell into obscurity, until a polymathic French scientist married to an American woman and living in Philadelphia rediscovered it nearly a century later and published it at his own expense. He dedicated the book to &#8220;the American people,&#8221; feeling that they were in dire need of a reminder that &#8220;knowledge is power&#8221; and that &#8220;in our republic, as power is confided to the care of the people, it is necessary that they should be correctly informed of vital points, so that they may avoid vital errors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bafflingly, the book was republished without the crucial and consummate illustrations &#8212; perhaps out of parsimony (this was the Panic of 1837, America&#8217;s first great economic depression), and perhaps in a clever marketing tactic, for the publisher&#8217;s introduction teased with the promise of a forthcoming separate folio containing only the illustrations. No record of such a publication survives, but I have restored these antique beauties from Wright&#8217;s original 1750 edition and made them available as prints and wearable artworks, benefiting the endeavor to build New York City&#8217;s <a href="https://pioneerworks.org/initiatives/observatory-at-pioneer-works/" target="_blank">first public observatory</a>.</p>

<p>Suspended halfway between the time of Kepler, who <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/12/26/katharina-kepler-witchcraft-dream/">discovered his revolutionary laws of planetary motion while defending his mother in a witchcraft trial</a>, and the time of Hubble &#8212; halfway between the age of superstition and the age of science &#8212; Wright, for all his visionary genius, was still trapped in the ideological monoculture of his time &#8212; a time that conceived of science as a handmaiden to theology, tasked not with discovering truth but with proving the perfection of a creator-god held as a postulate.</p>
<p>One of the chief and most unquestioned blind spots of this creationist mythology was the absolute faith in the infinity of time and space &#8212; a necessary framework to sustain the era&#8217;s unquestioned belief in personal immortality: If the soul were to go on forever, it necessitates a spacetime canvas of foreverness to go into. Although we now know that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/01/27/janna-levin-how-the-universe-got-its-spots-infinity/">&#8220;no infinity has ever been observed in nature&#8221;</a> and therefore the universe is by all probability finite, the notion of such finitude was offensive and intolerable to even the most visionary minds of Wright&#8217;s era, including his own. </p>

<p>Wright inveighed against the notion of finitude with passion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Creation must be not only extensively, but intensively indefinite, and beyond the reach of the human understanding to comprehend&#8230; The one is as necessary  as the other, i, e, an infinite expanse is as reconcileable to our reason, as infinite parts are to our senses.</p></blockquote>
<p>This might at first sound like a strikingly modern and reasonable argument, evocative of Carl Sagan&#8217;s poetic insistence that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/05/carl-sagan-jonathan-cott-rolling-stone-interview/">&#8220;the universe will always be much richer than our ability to understand it.&#8221;</a> But Wright&#8217;s rationale is theological rather than scientific, rooted not in the biological limits of human consciousness or the technological limits of our computational capacity but in the empirically untested and untestable blind belief in the existence of an omnipotent god:</p>
<blockquote><p>All the attributes of the Divine Being are, as any one of them, incomprehensible to his creatures; why should our imagination then be supposed to extend beyond the divine activity?</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a humbling reminder that every visionary of every era is still blinded by what they take as givens, and doubly humbling to realize that the same holds for each one of us along the miniature vistas of our everyday lives. And yet Wright was able to live beautifully within his own paradox, insisting again and again that astronomy is a supreme ally to reason and an impartial clarifying force for elemental truth &#8212; it allows us to see for ourselves what is true, to glimpse reality on its own terms, unmediated by ideological interpretation:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Astronomy&#8230; every man&#8217;s reason, by the help of a very little mathematics, is able to bring wonderful truths to light without them; and truths not only of the highest importance to every individual, but of a great and common consequence to all mankind&#8230; Time and observation will undoubtedly, at last, discover every thing to us necessary to our natures, and proper for us to know. As a proof of which, we see human wisdom daily increases.</p></blockquote>

<p>In his book, Wright also makes an exquisitely elegant argument for the existence of other planets orbiting other stars &#8212; a notion advanced by Pythagoras millennia earlier but still radical in Wright&#8217;s day, now proven four thousand times over by the pioneering NASA mission named for Kepler alone, with more such exoplanets constantly discovered by astronomers around the world. He serenades the beauty of deduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>To say that the Stars, which are a certain visible sort of contemporaries in space with the Sun, have no like planetary bodies like ours moving round them, because we cannot possibly see them, is no less absurd and ridiculous, than to argue, that we can have no reason to expect to find in the proper season, grapes upon every vine &#8212; figs upon every tree &#8212; roses upon every bush &#8212; only because some of them are at such a distance, that neither rose, fig or<br />
grape, can be discovered by the eye.</p></blockquote>

<p>After quoting Milton (whose <em>Paradise Lost</em> features the first English use of the word <em>space</em> in the astronomical sense), Wright adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>From certain observations only, we ought to form all our notions of [the universe], if we either hope to arrive at truth, or expect our ideas should be supported by reason.</p></blockquote>

Each day, being a creature of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/01/18/walking-love-barthes/">loops</a> and routines, I did my daily sprints along the exact same stretch of gravel by a blooming grapefruit tree on the edge of the farm. </p>
<p>One morning, just before Valentine&#8217;s Day, I halted my stride abruptly to avoid something peach-colored and lovely that the evolutionary triumph of my peripheral vision had registered in my path: two splendid rosy wolfsnails (<em>Euglandina rosea</em>), about to engage in the instantaneous courtship the human version of which has evolved to involve roses and love songs. I knelt on the gravel, sweaty and wondersmitten, to film these slow sensorial lovers with my already antique smartphone for as long as my knee could stand it. </p>
<p>At the time, I had just begun incubating the idea that eventually became <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/01/02/the-snail-with-the-right-heart/"><em>The Snail with the Right Heart</em></a>. As I composed the manuscript over the following months, I kept thinking about these tender creatures, learning about the science behind their mating, and chuckling at the thought of what the perfect soundtrack to their dance might be. </p>
<p>This is what I saw, now coupled with a perfect soundtrack courtesy of <a href="http://joanaspolicewoman.com" target="_blank">Joan as Police Woman</a>: &#8220;Run for Love&#8221; from her <a href="http://joanaspolicewoman.com/merch/" target="_blank">superb new live record</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/512221775?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="680" height="383" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Sexy Snails Run for Love"></iframe></p>
<p>The privilege of witnessing this love-dance at such intimate range inspired the central metaphor with which I met the greatest conceptual challenge with this children&#8217;s book predicated on the romance of reality &#8212; the portion of the story about how snails beget snails, tasked with accurately conveying concepts of science and sexuality to young readers who might not have the frame of reference for either:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is how it happens: When a snail finds a partner, the two face each other, gently touching their tentacles together to feel if they like each other. And if they do, they glide their bodies alongside one another in a slow double embrace, until their baby-making parts fit together like puzzle pieces. Then, they gently pierce each other with tiny spears called “love darts,” which contain their <em>genes</em> &#8212; the building blocks of bodies. Genes are like tiny seeds your parents plant in the garden that becomes your body &#8212; your special combination of seeds is what makes you <em>you</em>, what makes your body-garden unlike anyone else’s. Genes are how life talks to the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>When artist <a href="https://www.pingszoo.com/" target="_blank">Ping Zhu</a> first began working on the paintings that would eventually become the illustrations for the book, I giddily sent her the footage of the two rosy wolfsnails, which went on to inform and inspire her soulful interpretation of this wondrous evolutionary dance.</p>

<p>For a poetic PG counterpart, here is the incomparable Sir David Attenborough narrating the almost otherworldly mating dance of the snail&#8217;s unshelled cousin, filmed with far superior cinematic technology (if scored with an inferior soundtrack):</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A bittersweet signal from the discomposing territory between reason and hope.</h3>
<hr>
<p class="via"><em>This essay is excerpted from the thirteenth chapter of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/11/01/figuring/"><strong><em>Figuring</em></strong></a>, titled &#8220;The Banality of Survival.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/11/01/figuring/"><img class="cover" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/figuring_jacket_final.jpg" /></a>In the spring of 1849, ten years before <em>On the Origin of Species</em> shook the foundation of humanity&#8217;s understanding of life, the polymathic astronomer John Herschel &#8212; <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/04/03/virginia-woolf-julia-margaret-cameron-photography/">coiner of the word <em>photography</em></a>, son of Uranus discoverer William Herschel and nephew of Caroline Herschel, the world&#8217;s <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/04/27/janna-levin-reads-planetarium-by-adrienne-rich/">first professional female astronomer</a> &#8212; invited the forty-year-old <strong>Charles Darwin</strong> (February 12, 1809&ndash;April 19, 1882) to contribute the section on geology to an ambitious manual on ten major branches of science, commissioned by the Royal Navy. Darwin produced a primer that promised to make good geologists even of readers with no prior knowledge of the discipline, so that they might “enjoy the high satisfaction of contributing to the perfection of the history of this wonderful world.” </p>
<p>In submitting his manuscript, Darwin wrote to Herschel:</p>
<blockquote><p>I much fear, from what you say of size of type that it will be too long; but I do not see how I could shorten it, except by rewriting it, &#038; that is a labour which would make me groan. I do not much like it, but I have in vain thought how to make it better. I should be grateful for any corrections or erasures on your part.</p></blockquote>
<p>A perfectionist <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/08/28/darwin-anxiety/">prone to debilitating anxiety</a>, Darwin was vexed by the editorial process. But in the autumn of 1850, just as the manual was about to go to press, trouble of a wholly different order eclipsed the professional irritation: The Darwins’ beloved nine-year-old daughter, Annie &#8212; the second of their ten children and Charles’s favorite, fount of curiosity, sunshine of the household &#8212; fell ill with a mysterious ailment. </p>
<figure  class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/darwin_emma.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Emma and Charles Darwin</figcaption></figure>
<p>When Charles and <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/09/02/emma-darwin-love-letter-charles-darwin/">Emma</a> first realized that their daughter’s condition was more than a fleeting sickness, they turned to what the era’s medical authorities prescribe for sickly children: sea-bathing, believed to be a reliable cure-all for symptoms ranging from “languor and weakness of circulation,” per one medical encyclopedia, to cases of “listless and indolent state of the mind.” A natural history and travel guide from the era describes the craze for sea-bathing at Ramsgate, a coastal resort in Kent: “A sudden plunge into the ocean causes the blood to circulate briskly, and promotes the heat of the body.” It was to Ramsgate that the Darwins first sent Annie, hoping for maritime recovery. But her illness only escalated into fever and headaches.</p>
<p>A year earlier, the Darwins had traveled to the spa village of Malvern, where Charles was to try a new “cold water cure” devised by a Dr. James Gully. Darwin’s chronic illness at times manifested as insomnia, at other times as “dreadful vomiting every week.” It was never accurately diagnosed nor treated, and he was desperate for relief. One contemporary theory holds that he suffered from an acute anxiety disorder. Having read Dr. Gully’s <em>The Water Cure in Chronic Disease</em>, Darwin set his scientific skepticism aside and wrote to the physician, willing to try his treatment &#8212; he worried that the constant vomiting was getting in the way of his work. “If once half-well,” he wrote to <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/12/charles-darwin-letters-hooker-appreciation/">his best friend</a>, “I could do more in six months than I now do in two years.” </p>
<p>Dr. Gully’s treatment, developed in response to his two-year-old daughter’s death, included the vehement disavowal of medication. The little girl had been treated with every known drug at the time &#8212; including heavy metals like mercury, lead, and arsenic &#8212; and had died convulsed with harrowing pain. The bereaved father had set out to devise a course of alternative medicine. His hydropathy drew such famous patients as Lord Tennyson and Florence Nightingale &#8212; and now Charles Darwin. </p>

<p>In Darwin’s defense, this was a time when medical science was so rudimentary that it bled into the same metaphysical manipulation techniques that religious rhetoric used to keep belief systems and power structures in place. Such manipulation was only possible because the line between science and pseudoscience was blurred again and again as modern medicine was finding its footing. Because the body &#8212; especially woman’s body &#8212; was so poorly understood and the paradigm of clinical trials was generations away, most medical treatments in Darwin’s day were based on some combination of speculation, common lore, and anecdotal trial and error. This was an era when bloodletting was the primary treatment of a vast array of sickness and the majority of early childhood illnesses &#8212; from diarrhea and colic to fever and restlessness &#8212; were attributed to teething. The all-inclusive malady was the most commonly listed cause of infant death in local registers and was treated with a litany of allegedly curative barbarisms &#8212; blistering, bloodletting, and massive doses of dubious medication. Parents would lance the inflamed gums of their infants using unsterilized kitchen utensils, which often inflicted infections that ended up as the true cause of fatality. One of the most common medications was a solution of calomel powder &#8212; mercury &#8212; given to the child until he or she began to salivate, now a recognized symptom of acute mercury poisoning. With their tongues swollen to manyfold the usual size, children often died of dehydration following calomel treatment, but neither parents nor physicians implicated the drug in causality for half a century. It took many more decades to uncover the permanent neurological damage &#8212; from seizures to tremors to chronic fatigue &#8212; on those who survived the treatment, with mercury lodged in their bodies for life.</p>
<p>Because it bears repeating again and again that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/12/26/katharina-kepler-witchcraft-dream/">even the farthest seers can&#8217;t bend their gaze beyond their era&#8217;s horizon of possibility</a>, Darwin was trapped between the medical lore of his day and the ineradicable human hope for miracles. Although Dr. Gully’s belief in clairvoyance and general susceptibility to unscientific thought sat uncomfortably with Darwin, he came to like the hydropath a great deal and readily submitted to his methods &#8212; which included “cold feet baths and compress on the stomach,” as well as a proprietary “sweating process.” </p>
<p>The Darwins left Malvern after three months. In a letter to John Herschel penned in June 1849, Charles set aside his discontentment over the editorial tensions with the manual and instead enthused about the treatment’s “astonishingly renovating action” on his health:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before coming here I was almost quite broken down, head swimming, hands tremulous &#038; never a week without violent vomiting, all this is gone, &#038; I can now walk between two &#038; three miles. Physiologically it is most curious how the violent excitement of the skin, produced by simple water, has acted on all my internal organs.</p>
<p>I mention all this out of gratitude to a process which I thought quackery a year since, but which now I most deeply lament I had not heard of some few years ago.</p></blockquote>

<p>Despite Darwin’s elation over the effect of the “cold water treatment” on his own health, when Annie fell gravely ill, he couldn’t set aside his scientific doubts about Dr. Gully’s dubious beliefs in clairvoyance, homeopathy, and other pseudoscience. He scoffed in a letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Homœopathy] is a subject which makes me more wroth, even than does Clairvoyance: clairvoyance so transcends belief, that one’s ordinary faculties are put out of question, but in Homœopathy common sense &#038; common observation come into play, &#038; both these must go to the Dogs, if the infinetesimal doses have any effect whatever&#8230; No one knows in disease what is the simple result of nothing being done, as a standard with which to compare Homœopathy &#038; all other such things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Such things were out of the question when it came to Darwin’s most beloved child &#8212; he entrusted her health to traditional medicine. In November 1850, the Darwins took their daughter to London to be seen by the prominent physician who had supervised her birth. After a second futile visit the following month &#8212; Annie had added a barking cough to her swelling chest of symptoms &#8212; Darwin was once again desperate, betrayed by medical science. He finally gave in and wrote to Dr. Gully for advice, then commenced a water treatment at home under the doctor’s instruction, planning to take Annie back to Malvern in the spring for a proper “water cure.” But even this home remedy Darwin approached with scientific rigor. In a medical diary of sorts, he meticulously recorded Annie’s changing condition as he applied the six-part method, which included Dr. Gully’s proprietary “spinal wash” (a towel repeatedly drenched in icy water is swept up and down the patient’s spine) and “sweating by the lamp” (the patient is draped with a tent of sheets, under which a lamp containing alcohol is lit, producing nearly unbearable heat).</p>

<p>Although Annie would show intermittent signs of improvement &#8212; enough to give the anxious parents hope that what they were doing was effective &#8212; her health declined over the longer span of weeks. In the first days of spring, Darwin gave up on his home treatment, ended the medical diary, and braved the two-day passage to Malvern with Annie and two of her siblings, leaving Emma at home, seven months pregnant with the ninth of their ten children.</p>
<p>As Annie was lying mortally ill, Charles Dickens and his wife were also at Malvern, where Catherine Dickens was undergoing hydropathy to improve her shaky health. Dickens, who had just lost his father, left Kate at Malvern just after Darwin arrived with Annie and returned home, where he was given harrowing news: His youngest daughter, Dora &#8212; named after David Copperfield’s child bride &#8212; had died, not yet one, after a sudden and inexplicable series of seizures. A decade later, in <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/03/13/letters-of-consolation/">a letter of consolation</a> to his sister upon the loss of her husband, Dickens would write that while grief never fully leaves, “a real earnest strenuous endeavour to recover the lost tone of spirit” is necessary if one is to go on with life &#8212; observing that in “a determined effort to settle the thoughts, to parcel out the day, to find occupation regularly or to make it, to be up and doing something, are chiefly to be found the mere mechanical means which must come to the aid of the best mental efforts.” The strategy seems almost banal. But anyone who has lived through loss will recognize in it the essential banality of survival &#8212; we come unmoored, then buoy ourselves up with the flimsiest of lifeboats, cobbled together out of any plank and rope we can grasp.</p>

<p>On April 23, 1851, Annie Darwin dies in her father’s arms. Eight years later, <em>On the Origin of Species</em> would subvert the elemental human instinct with its argument for natural selection &#8212; the survival and improvement of the species through the demise of the individual. Death, Darwin would imply, is not unjust but inherently natural &#8212; part of the impartial laws holding the universe together, mortality unshackled from morality and metaphysics, leaving no room for charges of blame and pleas for mercy. “There is grandeur in this view of life,” Darwin would write, speaking perhaps to himself. Across the Atlantic, Emily Dickinson would <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/07/20/emily-dickinson-mother-death/">ponder this cycle</a> &#8212; “circuit,” she called it &#8212; of life and death: </p>
<blockquote><p>Seed, summer, tomb.<br />
Who’s doom &#8212;<br />
To whom?</p></blockquote>
<p>With Annie’s body still warm beside him, Darwin drags the pen across the letter paper, across the British archipelago, across his lacerated consciousness, to deliver to Emma the most undeliverable news in the universe. </p>
<p>“I am so thankful for the daguerreotype,” he writes.</p>

Having grown up looking in on the fencing academy in his neighborhood that only the privileged could attend &#8212; a separation the boy saw as emblematic of the antisemitism that swarmed his childhood &#8212; he had escaped into beauty, into dreams of seeing &#8220;all the paintings in the world.&#8221; In pursuit of that dream, he studied color separation and photochemistry in Germany and wandered the hallways of the great European art museums, absorbing the classics in the marrow of his imagination and growing especially enchanted by the seventeenth-century Dutch painters&#8217; mastery of color and light. Like <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/01/22/einstein-si-lewen-letter/">other visionary artists</a> of his ancestry and generation, he fled across the Atlantic  when the situation of European Jews grew grim on the cusp of the world&#8217;s first global war. </p>
<p>Born Miklós Mandl, he became <strong>Nickolas Muray</strong> (February 15, 1892&ndash;November 2, 1965) upon landing at Ellis Island with an English vocabulary of four dozen words and the unassailable determination to become an artist. Within a decade, he became one of the most celebrated portrait photographers of all time, doing for color photography what <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/04/03/virginia-woolf-julia-margaret-cameron-photography/">Julia Margaret Cameron had done</a> a century earlier just after the invention of photography, turning a new technology regarded as a crude tool of chemistry into a medium of fine art and a portal to beauty. The soirees at his Greenwich Village studio drew such dignitaries of creative culture as Langston Hughes, Martha Graham, Eugene O&#8217;Neill, and Jean Cocteau. He would live into his seventies and die a triumphant artist and a fencing champion, having competed for the U.S. Olympic team twice and having photographed some of the most recognizable faces of the twentieth century. </p>
<p>But none of his work would be more significant, to Muray or to the world, than his portrait of one of the most original and influential artists our civilization has produced &#8212; the great unexpected love of Muray&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>Nickolas Muray met <strong>Frida Kahlo</strong> (July 6, 1907&ndash;July 13, 1954) in 1931, while visiting the prominent painter, caricaturist, and art historian Miguel Covarrubias in Mexico. Muray had befriended him fifteen years earlier when the nineteen-year-old former student of Diego Rivera&#8217;s arrived in New York on a six-month stipend from the Mexican government and instantly captivated the art world with his singular caricatures; Covarrubias had used the platform of his own visibility to lift his friend up, becoming instrumental in Muray&#8217;s ascent to recognition. </p>
<p>Shortly after Covarrubias married another Mexican friend of Muray&#8217;s, the photographer traveled to visit the enamored couple, partly to restore his own faith in love after his bitter divorce from an advertising executive he had married a year earlier. That year, shortly after their own wedding, Frida and Diego had moved to San Francisco, attracting the attention of the city&#8217;s vibrant creative community as much with their art as with their vivacious and devoted open marriage. It as there that Kahlo and Muray first crossed orbits, but it was only when she returned to Mexico alone and ahead of Diego that they connected and commenced the decade-long romantic relationship that would eventually become a lifelong friendship. </p>

<p>Whatever transpired between Frida and Nick that spring in 1931, unwitnessed and unrecorded like all the great atomic passions, it imprinted them both deeply. What does survive from their first encounter are two parting gifts she gave him &#8212; items as curious for their intimacy as they are for their orthogonal messages. The first was a paper dolly, the kind used for serving sweets, inscribed with a dictionary-assisted attempt at Hungarian, broken and touching:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nick,</p>
<p>I love you like I would love an angel<br />
You are a Lillie of the valley my love.<br />
I will never forget you, never, never.<br />
You are my whole life<br />
I hope you will never forget this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beneath the date &#8212; the last day of May, 1931 &#8212; she added in English a passionate insistence that he return to Mexico that summer as he had promised he would, then sealed the note with the lipstick print of a kiss, beneath which she wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is specifically for the back of your neck.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second parting gift was a small self-portrait, almost a line drawing, in which Frida depicted herself holding Diego&#8217;s hand, with the faint outline of a fetus drawn over her dress. It foreshadowed the great heartbreak of Nick&#8217;s life &#8212; the abyssal mismatch between his longing to be her husband and her wish that he be only her lover. But at the elated outset of infatuation, we see only what we wish to see, turning a willfully blind eye to the very signs that would eventually spell the end of love. Nick could not have known it then, nor would he have wished to believe it, but Frida&#8217;s <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/22/frida-kahlo-diego-rivera-love/">otherworldly bond to Diego</a> &#8212; to whom she wrote <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/04/19/frida-kahlo-diary-love-letters/">her most soulful and passionate love letters</a> &#8212; would survive their multiple sidewise passions and even their divorce, eclipsing their multiple respective affairs with its unparalleled totality of devotion. Nick knew none of this at the dawn of their love, and perhaps nor did Frida. We hardly know where our hearts will go in the future, or where they will return. He would come to terms with this sadness only a decade into the relationship and only in facing the stark fact of Frida&#8217;s remarriage to Diego after their divorce. They would remain close friends for the remainder of Frida&#8217;s life. He would take more portraits of her than of any other person beyond his children. She would give him, straight from the easel, one of her most arresting and disquieting self-portraits, which would hang in his family living room for the remainder of his life. </p>

<p>Nearly a decade into the relationship, Frida&#8217;s love for Nick was as aglow with tenderness and passion as it had been that ecstatic first May. In February 1939, just after the centennial of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/04/03/virginia-woolf-julia-margaret-cameron-photography/">the science-driven invention of the artistic medium</a> that brought Nick into Frida&#8217;s life, she sent him a long and beautiful outpouring of heart, found in Salomón Grimberg&#8217;s altogether wonderful <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Will-Never-Forget-You-Nickolas/dp/0811856925/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>I Will Never Forget You: Frida Kahlo and Nickolas Muray</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/i-will-never-forget-you-frida-kahlo-nickolas-muray-unpublished-photographs-and-letters/oclc/67240869&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>). </p>
<p>Affectionately calling Nick her &#8220;child&#8221; despite his being fifteen years her senior, she writes to him in New York from Mexico:</p>
<blockquote><p>My beloved Nick,</p>
<p>This morning I received your letter after so many days of waiting. I felt such happiness that I started crying even before I read it. My child, I really should not complain about anything that happens to me in life, so long as you love me and I love you. [This love] is so real and beautiful that it makes me forget all my pain and problems; it makes me forget even distance. Through your words I feel so close to you that I can feel your laughter, so clean and honest, that only <em>you</em> have. I&#8217;m counting the days until my return. One more month! Then we&#8217;ll be together again.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a passage bespeaking the boundless sweetness between them, she adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Darling, I must tell you that you&#8217;ve misbehaved. Why did you send that check for 400 dollars? Your friend &#8220;Smith&#8221; is imaginary. It was a very nice gesture, but tell <em>him</em> that I will keep <em>his check untouched</em> until I come back to New York; we&#8217;ll discuss this matter then. My nick, you&#8217;re the sweetest person I&#8217;ve ever met. But listen, my love, I really don&#8217;t need the money now. I still have a little bit from Mexico; plus I&#8217;m a very rich bitch, did you know that? I have enough to stay one more month. I already have my return ticket. <em>Everything is under control</em>; it&#8217;s true, my love, it&#8217;s not fair that you spend extra money&#8230; I any event, you don&#8217;t know how thankful I am for your willingness to help me. I don&#8217;t have the words to describe how happy I am, knowing that you tried to make me happy and that you are so good and adorable&#8230; My lover, my heaven, my Nick, my life, my child, I adore you.</p></blockquote>

(Catalina Island Museum)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With a playful petulance, she proceeds to give him a winking list of instructions on his conduct until her return to New York, invoking objects in his home she had given him over the years as tokens of her love:</p>
<blockquote><p>Listen, my child, do you touch every day that thing for fires that hangs on the stair landing? Don&#8217;t forget to do it every day. Also, don&#8217;t forget to sleep on your little cushion, because I really like it. Don&#8217;t kiss anyone while you read the signs and names on the street. Don&#8217;t take anyone else to our Central Park. It belongs to Nick and Xóchitl [Frida&#8217;s nickname for herself, Aztec for <em>flower</em>] exclusively&#8230; Don&#8217;t kiss anyone on the couch in your office. Blanche Heys is the only one who may massage your neck. You can only kiss Mam as much as you want. Don&#8217;t make love to anyone, if you can help it. Do it only in case you find a real F.W. [fucking wonder], but <em>don&#8217;t fall in love</em>. Play with the electric train every once in a while if you aren&#8217;t too tired after work.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an expression of tenderly touching selflessness, in light of her own lifelong bodily devastation after the accident on an actual electric tram that had <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/08/29/frida-kahlo-illustrated-biography-cosford-alkayat/">nearly killed her as a teenager</a> and sent her into a series of brutalizing spinal surgeries, she adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Darling, don&#8217;t work so hard if you can help it, since it makes your neck and back tired. Tell Mam to take care of you and make you rest when you&#8217;re tired. Tell her that I&#8217;m much more in love with you, that you are my darling and lover, and that when I&#8217;m not around she has to love you more than ever to make you happy.</p>
<p>Is your neck bothering you a lot? I am sending you millions of kisses for your beautiful neck, so it will feel better, and all my tenderness and all my caresses for your body, from head to toe. I kiss each inch from far away.</p></blockquote>
<p>In consonance with her contemporary and admirer Susan Sontag&#8217;s insistence that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/03/15/writers-on-music/">&#8220;music is at once the most wonderful, the most alive of all the arts&#8230; and the most sensual,&#8221;</a> Frida ends the letter with one final instruction:</p>
<blockquote><p>Play the Maxine Sullivan record on the gramophone very often. I&#8217;ll be <em>there with you</em> listening to her voice. I can imagine you lying on the blue couch with your white cape on&#8230; and I hear your laughter &#8212; a child&#8217;s laughter&#8230; Oh, my dear Nick, I adore you so much. I need you so much that my heart hurts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Composed when Bishop was sorrowing after a separation from her partner, Alice Methfessel, it is a staggering poem about love and loneliness, about the feigned fearlessness and forced levity we put on like an armor, like a costume, to cope with the terrifying heaviness of loss. Originally published in <em>The New Yorker</em> on April 24, 1976, twenty years after Bishop won the Pulitzer Prize and six years after she won the National Book Award, the following year it crowned the final book of poems published in Bishop&#8217;s lifetime and now lives on in her indispensable posthumously collected <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poems-Elizabeth-Bishop/dp/0374532362/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Poems</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/poems/oclc/944324548?referer=br&#038;ht=edition" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>). </p>
<p>Alongside classics like Dylan Thomas&#8217;s <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/01/24/dylan-thomas-do-not-go-gentle-into-that-good-night/">&#8220;Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night&#8221;</a> and Sylvia Plath&#8217;s <a href="https://literaryjukebox.brainpickings.org/post/30583159689">&#8220;Mad Girl&#8217;s Love Song,&#8221;</a> &#8220;One Art&#8221; remains one of the greatest and most influential villanelles in the English language &#8212; sculptural masterworks of creative constraint, in which the virtuosity of language meets an exquisite mathematical precision in nineteen measured lines: five three-line stanzas and a final stanza of four lines, with the first and third line of the first stanza forming a refrain of alternating repetition across the remaining stanzas and then coming together into a chorus of a couplet in the closing verse. A haiku in the higher mathematics of meter. </p>

<p>It is the only villanelle Bishop ever wrote. She surprised even herself. A spare and careful poet who published very few and very meticulous poems, she composed it with astonishing rapidity, feeling that it was &#8220;like writing a letter,&#8221; redrafting and retitling it over and over. </p>
<p>&#8220;How to Lose Things.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The Gift of Losing Things.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The Art of Losing Things.&#8221; </p>
<p>And finally, fifteen drafts later, &#8220;One Art.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is always a delight to witness someone you love discover something you have long loved, and so it was with immense delight that I watched my dear friend <a href="http://amandapalmer.net" target="_blank">Amanda Palmer</a> discover &#8220;One Art&#8221; in real time while we were smiling at each other screen-mediated and pandemic-strewn across opposite corners of the globe, each comforting the other&#8217;s recent losses. Having just come upon the poem via one of <a href="http://patreon.com/amandapalmer" target="_blank">her patrons</a> and not yet read it, she read it to me extemporaneously while I mouthed the words committed to heart. I watched ripples of deeply personal resonance animate Amanda&#8217;s face as she made her way through the poem &#8212; a poem universal and timeless, a beautiful and brutal emissary of elemental truth, written half a century ago out of the tumults of the poet&#8217;s personal life, out of her very particular time and place and circumstance, suddenly rendered the ultimate pandemic poem for this moment we share and the myriad personal losses within it &#8212; a testament to the young Sylvia Plath&#8217;s precocious observation that an artist never knows how their work will live in the world and touch other lives, that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/03/sylvia-plath-letters-home-first-tragic-poem/">&#8220;once a poem is made available to the public, the right of interpretation belongs to the reader.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Bridging this bittersweet unbidden moment with our <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/tag/amanda-palmer/">longtime collaboration around poetry</a>, I asked Amanda to record a reading of the poem as it made its way into her veins to live with her as it has lived with, and as it will live with you. </p>

<blockquote><p><strong>ONE ART</strong><br />
<em>by Elizabeth Bishop</em></p>
<p>The art of losing isn’t hard to master;<br />
so many things seem filled with the intent<br />
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.</p>
<p>Lose something every day. Accept the fluster<br />
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.<br />
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.</p>
<p>Then practice losing farther, losing faster:<br />
places, and names, and where it was you meant<br />
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.</p>
<p>I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or<br />
next-to-last, of three loved houses went.<br />
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.</p>
<p>I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,<br />
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.<br />
I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster.</p>
<p>&mdash;Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture<br />
I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident<br />
the art of losing’s not too hard to master<br />
though it may look like (<em>Write</em> it!) like disaster.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bishop died not long after composing &#8220;One Art,&#8221; having requested the last two lines of another poem of hers as an epitaph: </p>
<blockquote><p>All the untidy activity continues,<br />
awful but cheerful.</p></blockquote>

I have always been struck by his metaphor &#8212; by both the exquisite truth of its tenor and the awful violence of its vehicle. A good book is indeed a profound transformation and, yes, there can be a violence to how it <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/01/19/anais-nin-on-reading/">awakens us from the trance of near-life</a>, but it is often a transformation of great subtlety and tenderness &#8212; an act of healing, a self-salvation, a self-creation. &#8220;Books and stories are medicine, plaster casts for broken lives and hearts, slings for weakened spirits,&#8221; Anne Lamott wrote in her <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/04/10/anne-lamott-velocity-of-being-letter-to-children/">lovely letter to children</a> a century after Kafka. As a child, Jane Goodall <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/01/31/jane-goodalls-reading-a-velocity-of-being/">read herself into her unexampled life</a>. As a girl cusping on adulthood, Helen Fagin <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/12/18/a-velocity-of-being-helen-fagin/">read herself alive through the Holocaust</a>. </p>
<p>We read for countless reasons and books transform us in countless ways, reckoned and unreckoned. We read the way we love &#8212; with our whole selves, with the flickering constellation of values, longings, traumas, joys, hopes, despairs, formative experiences, and half-remembered impressions composing the self. We read with our whole being, but we also read ourselves into being as each book quietly reconfigures the constellation with its cosmogony of ideas and the emotional voyage on which it takes us, so that we emerge from it a different self. That, too, is how love transforms us. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanette Winterson</strong> &#8212; one of the finest writers and thinkers of our time, a maker of axes and lifelines welded and woven of words &#8212; takes up the subject of why we read, a subject on which a reader is tempted to think nothing novel could be said, with uncommon splendor of insight in the introduction to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oranges-Are-Not-Only-Fruit-audiobook/dp/B07PGQKLFW/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank">Audible edition</a> of her 1985 classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oranges-Are-Not-Only-Fruit/dp/0802135161/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/oranges-are-not-the-only-fruit/oclc/951120974&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>
<p>Winterson begins where books begin &#8212; in the life and mind of the author, a fact so basic we have grown blind to its magic: How is it that a single person&#8217;s experience can become raw material for something that speaks to generations of strangers, something that shapes selves radically different from the author&#8217;s and from each other&#8217;s? She considers what it takes to write from a deeply personal place in a way that bridges the abyssal divide between consciousnesses:  </p>
<blockquote><p>The trick is to turn your own life into something that has meaning for people whose experience is nothing like your own. Write what you know is reasonable advice. Read what you don’t know is better advice.</p></blockquote>
<p>The unknown in life &#8212; the unknown in ourselves, the unknowns of the world &#8212; is always a double-edged sword of thrill and terror. The unknown in literature, Winterson observes in consonance with the central fact of life &#8212; the fact that we are always <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/03/18/figuring-shoreless-seeds-and-stardust/">figuring ourselves forward in an uncertain universe</a> &#8212; becomes a safe vessel from which to explore the uncharted territories of our knowledge and our self-knowledge: </p>
<blockquote><p>Reading is an adventure. Adventures are about the unknown. When I started to read seriously I was excited and comforted all at the same time. Literature is a mix of unfamiliarity and recognition. The situation can take us anywhere &#8212; across time and space, the globe, through the lives of people who can never be like us &#8212; into the heart of anguish we have never felt &#8212; crimes we could not commit.</p>
<p>Yet as we travel deeper into the strange world of the story, the feeling we get is of being understood &#8212; which is odd when you think about it, because at school learning is based on whether or not we understand what we are reading. In fact it is the story (or the poem) that is understanding us.</p>
<p>Books read us back to ourselves.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a sentiment particularly resonant to those of us who read ourselves through difficult lives, and out of them, and into improbable new lives, Winterson counsels on how to best read for self-transformation:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the things the story teaches us is this: Read yourself as a fiction as well as a fact.</p>
<p>When I was growing up poor in a poor place with a pair of Pentecostal parents who were waiting for Jesus to return and roll up time and space like a scroll, I never thought my life was narrow or my chances bleak. I thought I was Heathcliff, Huck Finn, Hotspur, Aladdin, the Big Bad Wolf. The Fish with a Golden Ring.</p>
<p>And later, when I had left home at sixteen and was living in a Mini, I had my favourite books stashed in the boot and whenever I could be in the library, I was there. This wasn’t a fantasy world or escapism &#8212; though it was an escape; it was the hidden door in the blank wall. Open it.</p>
<p>I opened the book and went through.</p>
<p>The escape into another story reminds us that we too are another story. Not caught, not confined, not predestined, not only one gender or passion. Learning to read yourself as a fiction as well as a fact is liberating &#8212; it is the difference between energy and mass. Mass is the beloved object &#8212; the world we can touch and feel &#8212; but mass is also the dead weight in ourselves and others.</p>
<p>Shifting the dead weight takes energy but at its atomic core the dead weight <em>is</em> energy. Transforming mass into energy, energy into mass is what creative work is about. An idea becomes embodied. A tragedy is released.</p></blockquote>
