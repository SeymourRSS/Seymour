If you ever use public Wi-Fi at, say, a hotel or a coffee shop, where I often work and as many of my listeners do, you’re often sending data over an open network, meaning no encryption at all.</p>



<p>A great way to ensure that all of your data is encrypted and can’t be easily read by hackers is by using&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/tim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ExpressVPN</a></strong>. All you need to do is download the ExpressVPN app on your computer or smartphone and then use the Internet just as you normally would. You click one button in the ExpressVPN app to secure 100% of your network data.&nbsp;<strong>Use my link&nbsp;<a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/tim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ExpressVPN.com/Tim</a>&nbsp;today and get an extra three months free on a one-year package!</strong></p>

<p><strong>This episode is brought to you by </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://piquetea.com/Tim" target="_blank"><strong>Pique Tea</strong></a><strong>! </strong>I first learned about Pique through my friends Dr. Peter Attia and Kevin Rose, and now <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://piquetea.com/Tim" target="_blank">Pique</a>’s fermented pu’er tea crystals have become my daily go-to. I often kickstart my mornings with their Pu’er Green Tea and Pu’er Black Tea, and I alternate between the two. Their crystals are cold-extracted, using only wild-harvested leaves from 250-year-old tea trees. Plus, they triple toxin screen for heavy metals, pesticides, and toxic mold—contaminants commonly found in tea. I also use the crystals for iced tea, which saves a ton of time and hassle.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://piquetea.com/Tim" target="_blank">Pique</a>&nbsp;is offering&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://piquetea.com/Tim" target="_blank">15% off of their pu’er teas</a>&nbsp;</strong>for the first time ever, exclusively to my listeners.&nbsp;<strong>Simply visit&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://piquetea.com/Tim" target="_blank">PiqueTea.com/Tim</a>, and the discount will be automatically applied.</strong>&nbsp;They also offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, so your purchase is completely risk free.

<h3>SHOW NOTES</h3>



<p><em>Note from the editor: Timestamps will be added shortly. </em></p>



<ul><li>In Joyce&#8217;s estimation, what is the most important &#8220;writerly&#8221; quality? On the obverse side, what does she consider to be the biggest obstacle to creativity?</li><li>What does Joyce suggest to novice writers for overcoming the obstacles to creativity they&#8217;ll inevitably encounter?</li><li>Why does Joyce need to envision the end of a novel and its title before she can really begin writing it? How does her process differ from that of her friend, the late E.L. Doctorow?</li><li>Once Joyce has her title and ending in place to write toward, does she ever change them along the way?</li><li>How does physical activity fit into Joyce&#8217;s creative process?</li><li>How fleshed out is a typical ending before the rest of the writing begins in earnest, and what does Joyce&#8217;s revision regimen look like? How does she decide what stays and what goes?</li><li>When the writer Jonathan Safran Foer was a student of hers, how did she select what she considered to be essential reading for this budding talent?</li><li>Jonathan says Joyce was the first person to take him seriously as a writer. But what was the catalyst that allowed her to begin taking herself seriously as a writer?</li><li>When <em>By the North Gate</em> was published in 1963, Joyce had already been featured in magazines and won awards for her writing. How important did that first book feel as a personal milestone at the time?</li><li>As &#8220;a sympathetic and careful reader,&#8221; how does Joyce encourage young writers in her classroom?</li><li>On overcoming writer&#8217;s block with a strong work ethic, and why a lot of women seem to struggle with treating the time it takes to create something as a valuable commodity.</li><li>Does Joyce work on multiple projects at once, or does she commit to just one at a time?</li><li>Joyce has said on numerous occasions that she&#8217;s one of the rare and lucky writers who doesn&#8217;t suffer anxiety around writing. Why does she think this is, and does this apply to all creative endeavors? What <em>would</em> make her anxious?</li><li>As someone who could see new ways to revise a draft upon every inspection, how does she decide when enough is enough and a piece of writing is ready for prime time?</li><li>Why is an Oscar Wilde quote about sincerity included in Joyce&#8217;s 10 tips for writing?</li><li>Why does Joyce feel it&#8217;s important to write for one&#8217;s contemporaries over writing for the sake of posterity? Can Joyce recall any impediments that have stood in the way of her own ability to follow this advice?</li><li>If Joyce believes a writer shouldn&#8217;t try to anticipate an ideal reader, who is she writing for? How does one stay true to this sentiment when writing for a publication with a particular kind of audience?</li><li>What kind of writing assignments could one of Joyce&#8217;s students expect to take on? What kind of assignment might she bring out to challenge her more advanced students, and how might it differ from something she&#8217;d assign a class of younger people?</li><li>How much of Joyce&#8217;s own work has she discarded before sending it to an editor or just removed from circulation?</li><li>On productivity: what does Joyce feel is the relationship between quantity and enduring quality of one&#8217;s work?</li><li>Of her own prolific body of work, what might she suggest first to someone who wants to get acquainted with it? Are there any she wishes could have been released with the same high profile treatment as <em>We Were the Mulvaneys</em> when it was selected for Oprah&#8217;s Book Club?</li><li>For someone who&#8217;s already written what would take most authors several lifetimes to accomplish, what&#8217;s still on Joyce&#8217;s list?</li><li>A final word of advice to writers and aspiring writers, and other parting thoughts.</li></ul>

<h3>SHOW NOTES</h3>



<ul><li>Here&#8217;s the story behind why I&#8217;ve taken to calling my guest Marc &#8220;The Seagull&#8221; Randolph. [05:35]</li><li>In his youth, what did involvement with the National Outdoor Leadership School (which he now chairs) teach Marc? Does NOLS offer such programs for adults? [10:00]</li><li>While discovering his own penchant for leadership, how did Marc&#8217;s communication style change? [15:27]</li><li>Homing in on a superpower: split testing. Where did Marc get bitten by the bug that endowed him with this ability? [18:27]</li><li>I share something I may have never shared with the public before, Marc explains what he meant when he said: &#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as a good idea.&#8221; He details some of the ideas he and Reed Hastings worked on before arriving at what we know today as Netflix, and shares the test they did to determine if the idea of video rental by mail was good or bad. [21:28]</li><li>What were the prerequisites of the business ideas Marc and Reed threw around before arriving on what would become Netflix? [27:11]</li><li>What did the approach to Netflix&#8217;s iteration look like in the early days, and what, in Marc&#8217;s opinion, sets apart good entrepreneurs from mediocre ones? [32:20]</li><li>How did Marc and Reed overcome the temptation to gear their startup toward what <em>seemed</em> to work in the &#8217;90s and what would go on to change the face of media consumption in the 21st century? [35:50]</li><li>Marc answers a question he perhaps never considered. [40:17]</li><li>How did Marc and Reed think about naming the company? What were their best and worst ideas, and how might arriving at this decision be different now versus then? [42:14]</li><li>Marc dishes about the time e-commerce demigod Jeff Bezos invited Reed and him to a sketchy part of Seattle for a &#8220;talk,&#8221; and how they prepared for it on the flight up. [46:19]</li><li>People told Marc and Reed, time and time again regarding the Netflix business model, &#8220;That&#8217;ll never work.&#8221; What were they missing? [56:09]</li><li>On the perfect storm of bad news that led to Marc and Reed trying to unload Netflix onto its then-biggest competitor: Blockbuster.[1:01:09]</li><li>Why didn&#8217;t Marc and Reed negotiate with Blockbuster for a lower buyout price when the company balked at the initial offer? [1:11:19]</li><li>What is the Canada Principle, and how has it guided Netflix&#8217;s unique business model in ways others might think of as leaving money on the table? What were the most tempting opportunities during this time that had to be turned away as distractions from Netflix&#8217;s main focus? [1:14:06]</li><li>How did Marc stick by his commitment to honor a regular date night with his wife without letting hectic startup life disrupt the balance? Has this tradition ever failed the stress test? [1:20:16]</li><li>What advice does Marc have for the success of couples considering instituting a similar date night tradition? [1:27:48]</li><li>The moment of clarity through which Marc found his purpose in life that led to writing <em>That Will Never Work</em> and starting a podcast by the same name. [1:30:32]</li><li>What can listeners to Marc&#8217;s podcast expect? [1:37:10]</li><li>What would Marc&#8217;s billboard say? [1:40:05]</li><li>Parting thoughts. [1:44:04]</li></ul>

<h3>SHOW NOTES</h3>



<ul><li>When he was in his teens, what did David aspire to be? [06:35]</li><li>Who was Ted Sorensen, and when did he enter the picture? [08:33]</li><li>Why do some of the best speechwriters in the history of politics seem to be extremely young, and how accurate is it to say that Ted Sorensen was JFK&#8217;s &#8220;intellectual blood bank&#8221; in his 30s? [10:26]</li><li>Viewing his career in law as a stepping stone into the world of politics, how did young David take criticisms that maybe he wasn&#8217;t cut out to be a lawyer? [12:45]</li><li>How did David end up as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy during the Carter administration? What did his first month working at The White House look like, and how did he learn to fulfill the duties expected of him? [14:27]</li><li>In hindsight, what does David consider the best decisions he had made up to this point in his career? [19:40]</li><li>David considers speaking, reading, and writing well to be crucial basic skills for anyone with the ambition to make something of themselves. What would be his methodology for teaching these skills to a college freshman class? [21:56]</li><li>What&#8217;s David&#8217;s process for giving a compelling, action-packed speech without relying on notes? [23:01]</li><li>Why &#8212; and at what age &#8212; did David decide to become an entrepreneur, and how might his life have turned out differently if Jimmy Carter had been reelected for a second term? [28:32]</li><li>Deciding to go into business for himself, David started a buyout firm. What does a buyout firm do, and why was this such a booming business in the late &#8217;70s and early &#8217;80s? [32:35]</li><li>What are the potential risks of a private equity deal, and how does David mitigate them? [37:39]</li><li>How did David and his partners arrive at the innovations that drove the success of the Carlyle Group? [43:11]</li><li>Described as a virtuoso of private fundraising, did David begin Carlyle with a global, Fidelity-style approach in mind? Why did he embrace the role of company fundraiser when it was traditionally something the industry delegated to third parties? Furthermore, how did Carlyle leverage its association with DC insiders to achieve brand recognition (and in what ways did this backfire when these associations operated in the political realm)? [46:21]</li><li>When Carlyle was implicated in the court of public opinion as being a behind-the-scenes player in orchestrating the war in Iraq, how did it affect David? [49:33]</li><li>What are some of the most common mistakes David sees novice fundraisers make, and why is it so hard to learn the ropes without making these kinds of rookie mistakes? [50:52]</li><li>What&#8217;s the origin story of the Carlyle Group name? [54:33]</li><li>How much was David trying to drum up during Carlyle Group&#8217;s initial round of fundraising, and how did he secure it in spite of no longer being a White House insider? [56:17]</li><li>David says: &#8220;If you have a good track record, you can raise an infinite amount of money.&#8221; But what does a good track record look like, and how did David differentiate Carlyle from other firms in its fundraising efforts? [58:02]</li><li>How did Carlyle compensate the company&#8217;s fundraising staff in a way that would retain their services and incentivize them to excel? [1:00:37]</li><li>What lessons did David learn from Jeff Bezos after interviewing him for his book <em>How to Lead</em>, and what deal does he wish Carlyle had made with him early on? [1:01:46]</li><li>What lessons and impressions did David glean from the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg? [1:05:45]</li><li>On the interview format as being a fairly modern innovation, why it&#8217;s a shame Johnny Carson couldn&#8217;t have interviewed Henry VIII or Alexander the Great, and the insights we might gain from listening to less-recognized voices. [1:07:51]</li><li>As someone who&#8217;s spent time among the world&#8217;s most powerful, David weighs in with his impressions of how power manifests itself in the halls of policy &#8212; and how it becomes more than just status, but a form of currency in certain circles. [1:10:37]</li><li>What books about power &#8212; its beneficent uses and malevolent abuses &#8212; does David recommend? [1:13:13]</li><li>Does David read fiction? As a voracious reader who aims to make it through a high volume of books each year, what&#8217;s the criteria for the ones that make it to his shelf? Does he ever give up on a book that doesn&#8217;t quite capture his interest, or will he soldier through it to the end? [1:16:40]</li><li>How does David think we can best address and correct the widespread problem of illiteracy &#8212; a major source of recidivism and income inequality? [1:21:20]</li><li>David&#8217;s advice to new parents who are financially successful but don&#8217;t want to raise kids who are complacent or entitled. [1:23:44]</li><li>At age 71, what fears, regrets, and hopes does David spend time thinking about? In what ways might we honor our parents if we still have time to do so? [1:27:16]</li><li>Must-do bucket list items. [1:32:24]</li><li>Called &#8220;Clark Kent in a suit and tie&#8221; on <em>60 Minutes</em>, what acts of patriotic philanthropy make David proudest? [1:34:06]</li><li>What would David&#8217;s billboard say? [1:38:05]</li><li>Parting thoughts. [1:38:46]</li></ul>

<p>One of my favorite sections is the epilogue, titled “The Master and the Fool,” which I’ve posted below with permission from Plume, an imprint of The Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House, LLC. <br><br>It explores a question:  What are the keys to rapid and lifelong learning? <br><br>There are many keys, but arguably the most important is found in this five-minute read&#8230;</p>



<h3><strong>The Master and the Fool</strong></h3>



<p>“I want you to tell me how I can be a learner.”</p>



<p>It was not so much a query as a demand, almost a threat. He was a mountain man, with the long black hair, bold moustache and rough-hewn clothing of a nineteenth-century outlaw, one of a breed that lived illegally in the rugged hills of the Los Padres National Wilderness Area along the Big Sur coast of California—a place of buzzards and hawks, mountain lions and wild boar. Having just turned in the final proofs of a book on education (it was in the late 1960s), I had driven four hours south from San Francisco for a weekend of relaxation at Esalen Institute.</p>



<p>As I approached the lodge—a rustic building built at the edge of the Pacific on one of the few areas of flat land between the sea and the mountains of the Los Padres—I heard the sound of conga drums. Inside, the mountain man was sitting at one of the drums, surrounded by eight other people, each also at a drum. He was apparently giving an informal lesson to whoever cared to participate. One of the drums was unoccupied. I pulled up to the unoccupied drum and joined the others, following the instruction as well as I could. When the session ended I started to walk away, but the mountain man came after me, grasped my shoulder, and fixed me with a significant look.</p>



<p>“Man,” he said, “you are a <em>learner</em>.”</p>



<p>I stood there speechless. I’d never met this person, and he certainly had no idea I had just finished a book about learning. My conservative city garb had probably led him to think that I was a complete novice at the conga drum, the instrument of choice of the counterculture, and thus he must have been impressed by my seemingly rapid progress. Still, I was so pleased by his words that I didn’t inform him I’d played before. He proceeded to tell me that he was a sculptor who worked metal with an acetylene torch, and that he was badly stuck and had been for a year; he was no longer a learner. Now he wanted me, a learner in his mind, to come up to his place in the Los Padres, look at his work, and tell him how <em>he</em> could be a learner. He was leaving right away and I could follow him in my car if I wished.</p>



<span id="more-54464"></span>



<p>The invitation baffled me, but I realized it was a rare opportunity to visit the forbidden haunts of one of the legendary mountain men of Big Sur, so I immediately accepted. I followed his battered sedan up a steep and tortuous dirt road, then across a mountain meadow to a driveway that was nothing more than two tire tracks through a forest of live oak, madrone, and bay trees. For what seemed a long time, the car lurched and labored steeply upward, coming at last to a clearing near the top of the coast range. In the clearing stood several wooden structures: a two-room cabin, a tool shed, a crude studio for metal sculpture, and something that might have been a chicken or rabbit coop. At one point during my visit, I spotted a slim young woman with flowing blonde hair and a long dress standing like a ghost near the edge of the clearing. He never mentioned her.</p>



<p>The mountain man showed me into a sturdily built cabin with a large front window looking 4,000 feet down to the Pacific, now shining like a sheet of metal in the late afternoon sun. We sat and made disjointed conversation for a while. I found myself somewhat disoriented. But for the presence of several conga drums, we might have been sitting in an early nineteenth-century pioneer’s cabin. It was all like a dream: the unlikely invitation, the rugged drive, the mysterious woman, the expansive gleam of the ocean through the trees.</p>



<p>When the mountain man announced that we would now go and look at his work so that I could tell him how to be a learner, I dumbly followed him out, having no idea of what I could possibly say that would be of any use to him. He walked me through his sculpture chronologically, showing me the point at which he had lost his creative spark, had stopped being a learner. When he finished, he fixed me with his eyes, and repeated his question one more time. </p>



<p>‘Tell me. How can I be a learner?&#8221;</p>



<p>My mind went absolutely blank, and I heard myself saying, “It’s simple. To be a learner, you’ve got to be willing to be a fool.”</p>



<p>The mountain man nodded thoughtfully and said “thanks.” There were a few more words, after which I got into my car and went back down the mountain. Several years were to pass before I considered the possibility that my answer was anything more than a part of one of those slightly bizarre, easily forgotten sixties episodes. Still, the time did come when ideas from other places—all sorts of ideas—began to coalesce around my careless words of advice, and I began to see more than a casual relationship between learning and the willingness to be foolish, between the master and the fool. By fool, to be clear, I don’t mean a stupid, unthinking person, but one with the spirit of the medieval fool, the court jester, the carefree fool in the tarot deck who bears the awesome number zero, signifying the fertile void from which all creation springs, the state of emptiness that allows new things to come into being.</p>



<p>The theme of emptiness as a precondition to significant learning shows up in the familiar tale of the wise man who comes to the Zen master, haughty in his great wisdom, asking how he can become even wiser. The master simply pours tea into the wise man’s cup and keeps pouring until the cup runs over and spills all over the wise man, letting him know without words that if one’s cup is already full there is no space in it for anything new. Then there is the question of why young people sometimes learn new things faster than old people; why my teenage daughters, for example, learned the new dances when I didn’t. Was it just because they were willing to let themselves be foolish and I was not?</p>



<p>Or you might take the case of an eighteen-month-old infant learning to talk. Imagine the father leaning over the crib in which his baby son is engaging in what the behaviorist B. F. Skinner calls the free operant; that is, he’s simply babbling various nonsense sounds. Out of this babble comes the syllable da. What happens? Father smiles broadly, jumps up and down with joy, and shouts, “Did you hear that? My son said ‘daddy.’” Of course, he didn’t say “daddy.” Still, nothing is much more rewarding to an eighteen-month-old infant than to see an adult smiling broadly and jumping up and down. So, the behaviorists confirm our common sense by telling us that the probability of the infant uttering the syllable da has now increased slightly.</p>



<p>The father continues to be delighted by da, but after a while his enthusiasm begins to wane. Finally, the infant happens to say, not da, but dada. Once again, father goes slightly crazy with joy, thus increasing the probability that his son will repeat the sound dada. Through such reinforcements and approximations, the toddler finally learns to say daddy quite well. To do so, remember, he not only has been allowed but has been encouraged to babble, to make “mistakes,” to engage in approximations—in short, to be a fool.</p>



<p>But what if this type of permission had not been granted? Let’s rerun the same scene. There’s father leaning over the crib of his eighteen-month-old son. Out of the infant’s babble comes the syllable da. This time, father looks down sternly and says, “No, son, that is <em>wrong!</em> The correct pronunciation is <em>dad-dy</em>. Now repeat after me: <em>Dad-dy. Dad-dy. Dad-dy.</em>”</p>



<p>What would happen under these circumstances? If all of the adults around an infant responded in such a manner, it’s quite possible he would never learn to talk. In any case, he would be afflicted with serious speech and psychological difficulties.</p>



<p>If this scenario should seem extreme, consider for a moment the learnings in life you’ve forfeited because your parents, your peers, your school, your society, have not allowed you to be playful, free, and foolish in the learning process. How many times have you failed to try something new out of fear of being thought silly? How often have you censored your spontaneity out of fear of being thought childish? Too bad. Psychologist Abraham Maslow discovered a childlike quality (he called it a “second naivete”) in people who have met an unusually high degree of their potential. Ashleigh Montagu used the term neotany (from neonate, meaning newborn) to describe geniuses such as Mozart and Einstein. What we frown at as foolish in our friends, or ourselves, we’re likely to smile at as merely eccentric in a world-renowned genius, never stopping to think that the freedom to be foolish might well be one of the keys to the genius’s success or even to something as basic as learning to talk.</p>



<p>When Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo, was quite old and close to death, the story goes, he called his students around him and told them he wanted to be buried in his white belt. What a touching story; how humble of the world’s highest-ranking judoist in his last days to ask for the emblem of the beginner! But Kano’s request, I eventually realized, was less humility than realism. At the moment of death, the ultimate transformation, we are all white belts. And if death makes beginners of us, so does life—again and again. In the master’s secret mirror, even at the moment of highest renown and accomplishment, there is an image of the newest student in class, eager for knowledge, willing to play the fool.</p>



<p>And for all who walk the path of mastery, however far that journey has progressed, Kano’s request becomes a lingering question, an ever-new challenge:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Are you willing to wear your white belt?</strong></p>

<p><strong>“</strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/still-alive" target="_blank"><strong>Still Alive</strong></a><strong>” by Scott Siskind, better known as “Scott Alexander” (</strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex?lang=en" target="_blank"><strong>@slatestarcodex</strong></a><strong>). </strong>This really struck a chord, and if you are considering growing your audience or “platform,” make this essay part of your required reading. This bullet will be a bit longer and more heated than usual, as it reopened old wounds.<br><br>Some of my dear friends are journalists, and they’re wonderful people. They measure twice and cut once. They are thoughtful, unrushed, and considerate, despite organizational pressure and incentives to be the opposite. That takes extraordinary discipline, and it’s fucking hard. It isn’t the path of least resistance, and I admire the hell out of them for doing what is right, despite the uphill path. This includes some amazing humans at the NYT. This praise doesn’t mean that they write fluff pieces; it means they aim to be fair and humane and take the time necessary to think about ethics and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule" target="_blank">Golden Rule</a>.<br><br>That said, there is a great-to-terrible spectrum for any professional group, including surgeons, elementary school teachers, politicians, hot dog vendors, and, yes, even journalists. There are people in all walks of life who are spiteful, narcissistic, harried, or simply uncaring. They do what is easiest and best for them personally, and what is expedient, without thought to those vulnerable to their mistreatment. Perhaps it’s from fatigue, perhaps it’s from outside pressure, perhaps it’s from ill will, but the outcomes are often the same. Sadly, there are journalists who earn a living by repeatedly earning trust and betraying it; they are a minority, but they clearly exist. I don’t say this about anyone referred to in Scott’s essay, as I’m not in the know, but based on my personal experience with hundreds of interviews over 10+ years, plus other authors’ similar experiences. There are great people in the unlikeliest of places, and there are bad apples at even the best publications. Don’t assume a good masthead means you are in safe hands.<br><br>This <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/still-alive" target="_blank">entire essay by Scott</a> can serve as a cautionary tale about public exposure, fame, privacy, and living life. The “don’t kick me in the balls” section speaks to deeper truths and risks of the spotlight. Personally, I’ve been misquoted by tier-one newspapers and even threatened by one writer at a newspaper of record. Why was I threatened? Because I asked that he only include my answers if he quoted them in full, instead of pulling single sound bites out of context, which he’d done before. This was for an online piece, so there were no space constraints. He got very upset and wrote directly, “You are not in control,” and proceeded to explain the power dynamic. Endearing, eh? I immediately saved and drafted that exchange as a just-in-case blog post, which I still have. Thankfully, I didn’t need it then, and I can only guess that he realized the liability of explicitly typing what he did. That’s an edge case. There are tougher cases that don’t leave as obvious a paper trail. For example, I’ve had fact-checkers at a magazine famous for fact-checking *not* make the corrections I provided via phone, which resulted in a grossly inaccurate profile that will sit in Google results for years and probably decades. Lesson learned: only do fact-checking via email. For these reasons and more, I rarely do print interviews any longer, and if I do, I use email or insist on also having recordings of the conversations. Pro tip: ensure you ask to record on your side and have your own audio (via Skype, QuickTime, Zoom, or other), as I’ve also had several writers promise to send their audio and then never do so, despite multiple follow-ups. As <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tim.blog/2014/08/04/mike-shinoda/" target="_blank">Mike Shinoda</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/mikeshinoda" target="_blank">@mikeshinoda</a>) says in Fort Minor’s “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-bbSmDq9aw" target="_blank">Get Me Gone</a>”:<br><br>“After that I made it a rule:<br>I only do E-mail responses to print interviews<br>Because these people love to put a twist to your words<br>To infer that you said something fucking absurd<br>&#8230;<br>Now I’ve got the interviews on file<br>Which people said what, which number to dial”<br><br>Again, in the world of media, as in any group of humans, there are the good, the bad, and the ugly. There are some beautiful humans and some deplorable humans, and a vast majority fall somewhere in between, depending on which side of the bed they wake up on. Plan accordingly. And if you want more scary bedtime stories, alongside some tactical points, consider reading <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tim.blog/2020/02/02/reasons-to-not-become-famous/" target="_blank">11 Reasons Not to Become Famous</a>.<br><br>Fame, even micro-celebrity, is like a razor-sharp scalpel with no handle; it easily cuts both ways.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;<strong>Trying to do something that no one&#8217;s ever done before, you really have to approach it in every single different way possible than ever has been done before. There is no blueprint for it.&#8221; </strong></em><br>— Michael Phelps<br><br><em><strong>&#8220;Just be you and feel comfortable in that.&#8221;</strong></em><br>— Grant Hackett</p>



<p><strong>Michael Phelps</strong> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/michaelphelps" target="_blank">@michaelphelps</a>) is widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time. He captured 28 medals, including a record-setting 23 gold medals, and set 39 world records over the course of his career. Michael utilized his performance bonus for winning eight gold medals in 2008 to establish the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://michaelphelpsfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Michael Phelps Foundation</a>, which promotes water safety, healthy living (physical and mental), and the pursuit of dreams. The foundation’s signature program—IM—is a learn-to-swim, healthy living, and goal-setting curriculum based on the principles and tools Michael utilized in his swimming career and is available through the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and Special Olympics International. His advocacy for water safety and mental health has earned him the recognition of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America (Champion of Youth), American Image Awards (Humanitarian Award), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Special Recognition Award), the Ruderman Family Foundation (Morton E. Ruderman Award in Inclusion), and PR Week (Health Influencer 50 and 2020 Communicator of the Year), among others.</p>



<p>Michael served as an executive producer and featured talent in the HBO documentary <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-weight-of-gold" target="_blank"><strong><em>The Weight of Gold</em></strong></a>, which explores the mental health challenges Olympic athletes often face. In addition, he has published two autobiographies, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Limits-audiobook/dp/B001O1ZXPG" target="_blank"><em>No Limits: The Will to Succeed</em></a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beneath-Surface-Story-Michael-Michael/dp/1683580877" target="_blank"><em>Beneath the Surface</em></a>, which were <em>New York Times</em> and <em>USA Today</em> bestsellers, and one children’s book, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Train-Rex-Gold-Medals/dp/1416986693" target="_blank"><em>How to Train with a T-Rex and Win 8 Gold Medals</em></a>.</p>



<p><strong>Grant Hackett</strong> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/grant__hackett/?hl=en" target="_blank">@grant__hackett</a>) represented and captained Australia in swimming at the Olympic Games. He collected a total of 58 medals over the course of his swimming career—with 26 gold at Olympic, Commonwealth, and World Championships levels—along with 16 world records. He remained unbeaten for 11 years in his pet event, the 1500m freestyle. Grant also received prestigious honors such as the Order of Australia, Centenary Medal, and Australian Sports Medal. Grant is a member of the Sports Australia Hall of Fame and International Swimming Hall of Fame.</p>



<p>His qualifications include an executive master of business administration with first-class honors, a diploma of business law, and a diploma of financial services. Grant is the CEO of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://genlife.com.au/" target="_blank">Generation Life</a>, an Australia-based investment firm managing more than $1.3 billion.</p>

<h3>SHOW NOTES</h3>



<ul><li>Grant starts us off by recounting why his 1,500-meter freestyle race at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens was the most painful of his career &#8212; even though he walked away with a gold medal for his trouble. [07:56]</li><li>When it comes to suffering for a race, Michael concurs that he&#8217;s been luckier than Grant (though this might be chalked up to preparation). But they both have an obsession with studying &#8212; and training to beat &#8212; the numbers. Is this common in their corner of athleticism? [14:47]</li><li>How did Michael and Grant come to meet and eventually train together? What did each see in the other as admirable and innovative? [18:59]</li><li>It&#8217;s common for Grant and Michael to train 30 to 40 hours per week, and Michael even trained more than 540 days straight to prepare for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. How do they keep from burning out? [26:07]</li><li>What does Michael do to treat his body like a Ferrari and keep it performing at its best, and how does Grant ensure he&#8217;s getting optimal sleep? [32:29]</li><li>Why might a competitive swimmer want to avoid hiking regularly? [39:04]</li><li>Far from being thwarted by critical remarks, Michael uses them as fuel to excel even harder. What kind of &#8220;fuel&#8221; did Ian Thorpe provide for Michael at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing? Did relying on this kind of fuel generate anger, or did it channel it from somewhere it already existed? What is Michael&#8217;s relationship with anger now that he&#8217;s no longer competing, and how does he manage it &#8212; especially during the pandemic? [40:22]</li><li>Michael opens up about the first time he experienced depression and how he came to understand and accept that he needed help. What made this experience particularly scary, and what has he learned about coping with episodes of depression since then? [47:44]</li><li>Books that have helped Michael get in touch with his spiritual side, and how his kids remind him to treasure the simple things in life. [55:50]</li><li>What have the dark times looked like for Grant, and what has he taken away from them? [1:00:54]</li><li>Rules and strategies that have helped Grant nurture his mental health. [1:06:13]</li><li>Does Grant see a therapist regularly? How does he know when it&#8217;s time to check in, and what does the format look like? [1:10:06]</li><li>Does Michael check in with a therapist regularly? How does writing down his feelings help him process what he&#8217;s going through? [1:17:15]</li><li>Michael talks about his feelings surrounding involvement in &lt;em&gt;The Weight of Gold&lt;/em&gt;, an HBO sports documentary exploring the mental health challenges that Olympic athletes often face &#8212; and why he&#8217;s grateful it came out during the COVID pandemic. [1:22:07]</li><li>Books and resources Grant has found conducive toward maintaining mental health (and Michael chimes in with a few he&#8217;s thought of since I asked him).

<p>Happy New Year, all!&nbsp;<br><br>A close friend of mine recently asked me for a cheat sheet for getting into better shape in 2021. He specifically asked about supplements and abs several times. He’s looking for a rapid reboot.</p>



<p>The below is what I sent him, along with a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=030746363X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The 4-Hour Body</em></a>,<em> </em>which was recently featured in a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2021/01/09/10-most-popular-diet-books-decade-usa-today-bestsellers-list/4026414001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>USA Today</em> list</a> of the top-10 most popular diet books of the last decade.<br><br>This blog post is minimally edited. I’m not trying to be Tolstoy; rather, I wanted to share a quick and dirty email of tactical advice to a friend who has limited time, a bunch of kids, no ability to go to a public gym during COVID, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I’m also simplifying a lot to get my point across quickly, so read it with that in mind. Needless to say, I’m not a doctor and none of this is medical advice. Chat with your MD and do your homework on supplements before consuming anything new.<br><br>My friend is also a roughly 200-pound male, so adjust kettlebell weights accordingly. Pavel Tsatsouline has <a href="https://www.strongfirst.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent further resources</a>.</p>



<p>Enjoy…&nbsp;</p>



<p>###</p>



<p>Ahoy, Santiago!</p>



<p><strong>If you follow the directions in the below links for four weeks, you should see some significant changes.</strong></p>



<span id="more-54394"></span>



<p>First, just a few basics:</p>



<p>&#8211; Weight training will help with fat loss and appearance more than cardio, as it helps to build muscle, which then changes your metabolism.</p>



<p>&#8211; As they say, “Abs are made in the kitchen.” We all have abs, and it’s diet that will make them visible or invisible, so diet is 90%-plus of seeing abs.</p>



<p>&#8211; Supplements can be helpful, but they are called “supplements” for a reason. They should supplement other more important changes to diet and exercise.</p>



<p>OK, here are my suggestions for the next 4–6 weeks, listed from most important to least important:</p>



<p><strong>DIET&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Focus on the Slow-Carb Diet. You get one “cheat day” per week to go crazy and eat whatever you want, so you’re not giving up your favorite foods for more than 6 days at a time. It really, really works.</p>



<p>These two articles are good starting points:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tim.blog/2012/07/12/how-to-lose-100-pounds/" target="_blank">How to Lose 100 Pounds on the Slow-Carb Diet – Real Pics and Stories</a><br><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/better-humans/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slow-carb-diet-a67062761d92" target="_blank">Everything You Need to Know About the Slow-Carb Diet<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></p>



<p>Also feel free to print <a href="https://tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tim_ferriss_the-4-hour-chef_one_pager_slow_carb_diet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this Slow-Carb diet one-pager</a> from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0547884591/ref=as_li_ss_tl/?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373&#038;creativeASIN=0547884591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The 4-Hour Chef</em></a><em>, </em>which encapsulates nearly all the main points.</p>



<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>



<p><strong>Focus on kettlebell swings. </strong>Do these 2x per week and see these, in this order:</p>



<p>1.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='600' height='338' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbNCC-BMNKg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>2. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tim.blog/2011/01/08/kettlebell-swing/" target="_blank">The Perfect Posterior: Kettlebell Swings and Cheap Alternatives</a></p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the above blog post:</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p><em>In 2005, my interest in kettlebells reinvigorated, I returned to the United States from Argentina and purchased one 53-pound kettlebell. I did nothing more than one set of 75 swings one hour after a light, protein-rich breakfast, twice a week on Mondays and Fridays. In the beginning, I couldn’t complete 75 consecutive repetitions, so I did multiple sets with 60 seconds between until I totaled 75. Total swing time for the entire week was 10–20 minutes.</em></p>



<p><em>I wasn’t trying to balance tequila shots on my butt cheeks. I wanted clear six-pack abs. In six weeks, I was at my lowest bodyfat percentage since 1999, and l’d reached my goal. I’ve since worked up to 50+ reps with the 106-lb. “beast,” which has directly transferred to 100-lb.+ gains in the deadlift.</em></p>



<p><em>The king of exercises—the two-handed kettlebell swing—is all you need for dramatic changes.</em></p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<p><strong>BASICS</strong></p>



<p>Get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Rep-24-Kettlebell-Strength-Conditioning/dp/B00NLS0L0M/?th=1" target="_blank">a 35-lb kettlebell</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Rep-24-Kettlebell-Strength-Conditioning/dp/B00NLS0NOG" target="_blank">a ~53-lb kettlebell</a> to start. Do one week of the lighter then move up to the 53. After the 4–6 week experiment, you might buy one that is heavier. Good idea to use chalk on your hands.</p>



<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTS</strong><br><br>&#8211; Eat 30 grams (30g) of protein within 30 minutes of waking up. I know this isn&#8217;t a supplement, but it&#8217;s important, so I&#8217;m putting it here, since I think you might skip to this section. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>&#8211; Consider 1000mg of cissus quadrangularis before lunch.</p>



<p>&#8211; Take 100–300mg of alpha-lipoic acid 30 min before dinner.</p>



<p>&#8211; Take 3,000–5,000iu of vitamin D before bed.<br><br>For now, that&#8217;s PLENTY!&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=030746363X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The 4-Hour Body</em></a> will have much more to explore, if you like. Hardcover will be on its way to you.</p>



<p>Un abrazo!</p>



<p>Tim</p>



<p>###&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>P.S. </strong>To bring some optimism into 2021, I’d like to quote from an email I received at the end of 2008 from a mentor of more than two decades:</p>



<p><em>While many are wringing their hands, I recall the 1970s when we were suffering from an oil shock causing long lines at gas stations, rationing, and 55 MPH speed limits on Federal highways, a recession, very little venture capital ($50 million per year into VC firms), and, what President Jimmy Carter (wearing a sweater while addressing the Nation on TV because he had turned down the heat in the White House) called a “malaise.” It was during those times that two kids without any real college education, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, started companies that did pretty well. Opportunities abound in bad times as well as good times. In fact, the opportunities are often greater when the conventional wisdom is that everything is going into the toilet.</em></p>



<p><em>Well…we’re nearing the end of another great year, and, despite what we read about the outlook for 2009, we can look forward to a New Year filled with opportunities as well as stimulating challenges.</em></p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Once again, Happy New Year, everyone!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SHOW NOTES</h3>



<ul><li>Reminiscing about the last time we hung out together pre-COVID. [05:26]</li><li>Thoughts on COVID-era cryptomania, how we&#8217;ve invested in cryptocurrency in the past and present, where we see it headed, and some of the red flags we might want to keep an eye on. (Reminder: this is not financial advice. This is for informational and entertainment purposes only.) [06:49]</li><li>How we&#8217;ve been rebalancing other assets in our portfolios during these especially uncertain times, what the lessons learned in 2020 mean for further decisions &#8212; financial and non-financial &#8212; and why I think ahead in blocks of three years rather than five or 10. [33:59]</li><li>Kevin shares what he&#8217;s learned from spending &#8220;a crap ton&#8221; of time researching applications for tracking finances: the good, the bad, and the ugly, and we examine the evidence indicating that he may have a legitimate financial dashboard fetish. [56:38]</li><li>Why I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot more about energy management than time management. [1:02:50]</li><li>The best nonfiction book I&#8217;ve read in the last five years, and revisiting why, in 2020, I chose to read no books that were published in 2020 (and, by extension, be more purposeful about how I spend time in general). [1:06:12]</li><li>Kevin and I talk about how we&#8217;re learning to best enjoy the time we spend in nature &#8212; whether this involves listening to audiobooks in real-time (or not at all) or identifying the sights and sounds of the wilderness &#8212; and why I&#8217;m having trouble reacclimating to Austin after a summer spent in the woods among the black bears, coyotes, birds, and trees. [1:15:12]</li><li>Exploring the worlds of lucid dreaming, Zen enlightenment, and reality checks. [1:22:46]</li><li>Ways we&#8217;ve found to cope with ourselves and our loved ones (and for them to cope with us) during the extended quarantine. [1:30:44]</li><li>Kevin&#8217;s word for 2021, and how he&#8217;s applying it to drink less than the power of COVID compels him. [1:44:08]</li><li>As Kevin&#8217;s alcohol consumption goes down, does his edible gummies consumption go up? [1:46:50]</li><li>Kevin raves about the benefits of Japanese Hinoki wood and its oil. [1:49:12]</li><li>My word for 2021 as an antidote to the seriousness of 2020 and a reality check against the expectations manufactured by social media. [1:51:27]</li><li>Recommended documentaries, movies, and shows we&#8217;ve been watching this year. [1:59:07]</li><li>Thoughts on healthy Hawaiian venison snacks and hunting. [2:04:51]</li><li>Food investment forays and final thoughts. [2:10:42]</li></ul>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center"><strong>MY FAVORITE AND MOST IMPACTFUL READS FROM 2020</strong></h3>



<p><strong>What I’m reading — (week of December 30, 2019) <br></strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/12/26/katharina-kepler-witchcraft-dream/" target="_blank"><strong>How Kepler Invented Science Fiction and Defended His Mother in a Witchcraft Trial While Revolutionizing Our Understanding of the Universe</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Maria Popova (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/brainpicker/" target="_blank">@brainpicker</a>) is simply amazing. Her prose is worth reading for its beauty alone (keep in mind that English is not Maria’s native language!), and the stories in this essay highlight just how brilliant, stupid, ignorant, and insightful humans can be… sometimes all at the same time. Hat tip to JZ for the recommendation.<br><strong><br>What I’m reading — (week of January 6th) <br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://paulgraham.com/kids.html" target="_blank">Having Kids</a></strong> by Paul Graham (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/paulg" target="_blank">@paulg</a>). Here is one of my favorite sections: “I remember perfectly well what life was like before. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the ability to take off for some other country at a moment’s notice. That was so great. Why did I never do that? … See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before kids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used it.”</p>

<p><strong>Article I’m reading — (week of January 13th) <br></strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/162/3859/1243.full.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>The Tragedy of the Commons</strong></a><strong> </strong>by Garrett Hardin, <em>Science</em>, December 13, 1968, 1243–1248. Thanks to Shane Parrish (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ShaneAParrish" target="_blank">@ShaneAParrish</a>) of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fs.blog/" target="_blank">Farnam Street</a> for pointing me to this. This is an incredibly thought-provoking read. Even if you think you understand the concept of the “tragedy of the commons,” this original piece that introduced the phrase offers a lot of food for thought.<br><br><strong>Article I’m contemplating — (week of January 20th) <br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank">Reality has a surprising amount of detail</a></strong> by John Salvatier (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/johnsalvatier?lang=en" target="_blank">@johnsalvatier</a>). This 2017 beauty was sent to me by my dear friend, Pineapple-Eating Cat (long story). It made me recall <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tim.blog/2017/11/08/tim-oreilly/?utm_source=convertkit&amp;utm_medium=convertkit&amp;utm_campaign=5bf" target="_blank">my conversation with Tim O’Reilly</a> and his daily habit of pausing to take a photograph of a flower. If you read this article (and it only takes 5–10 minutes), be sure to read to the end. Here’s a teaser paragraph:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This means it’s really easy to get stuck. Stuck in your current way of seeing and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem important to you. The important details you haven’t noticed are invisible to you, and the details you have noticed seem completely obvious and you see right through them. This all makes it difficult to imagine how you could be missing something important.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>What I’m reading — (week of January 27th) <br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/my-joe-rogan-experience/594802/" target="_blank">Why Is Joe Rogan So Popular?</a></strong> (<em>Atlantic</em>) by Devin Gordon (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/DevinGordonX" target="_blank">@DevinGordonX</a>). This is one of the best explorations of Joe that I’ve come across. Devin captures the zeitgeist—with real insight into Joe and his format—better than anyone I’ve seen to date. Here is one of many sections that struck me, slightly edited for length:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[One journalist wrote,] &#8220;If traditional media were pissed about anything relevant to the Musk-Rogan interview, it was the extent to which Rogan got played.&#8221;</p><p>Played! Imagine writing that about one of the most discussed and downloaded podcasts of 2018. Rogan, the one who handed Elon Musk a spliff, on camera, and got him to smoke it, thus earning national headlines for himself and millions of listens for his advertisers, got played. In order to reach such a conclusion, you have to begin with the presumption that interviews must always be a form of combat, with winners and losers….</p><p>The hard truth for some of Rogan’s critics in the media is that he is much better at captivating audiences than most of us, because he has the patience and the generosity to let his interviews be an experience rather than an inquisition. And, go figure, his approach has the virtue of putting his subjects at ease and letting the conversation go to poignant places, like the moment when Musk reflected on what it was like to be Elon Musk as a child—his brain a set of bagpipes that blared all day and all night. He assumed he would wind up in a mental institution. “It may sound great if it’s turned on,” he said in his blunt mechanical way, “but what if it doesn’t turn off?</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>What I’m reading — (week of February 3rd)</strong><br><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/long-reads/digital-nomad-jobs-work-careers-how-to-be-freelance-travel/349014" target="_blank">Digital nomad: this is the reality of living the ‘dream’ Instagram lifestyle</a></strong> by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ellyearls.com/" target="_blank">Elly Earls </a>(<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ellyjearls" target="_blank">@ellyjearls</a>). This piece highlights some of the risks of working remotely, as well as the incredible importance of community. Pair it with “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/01/29/remote-workers-are-not-all-digital-nomads/#1cb5180e7d83" target="_blank">Remote Workers Are Not All Digital Nomads</a>” by Weiting Liu (<a href="https://twitter.com/weitingliu">@weitingliu</a>).</p>



<p><strong>Article I’m reading and rereading — (week of February 10th)<br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/body-count/" target="_blank">Body Count” by Epsilon Theory/Ben Hunt</a> (</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/EpsilonTheory"><strong>@epsilontheory</strong></a><strong>). </strong>This was sent to me by one of my smartest and most connected friends. It paints a spooky picture of the Chinese reports of what has informally been referred to as “Wuhan coronavirus.” Per the WHO at the time of this writing, the official virus name is SARS-CoV-2, and the disease it causes is COVID-19, much like HIV causes AIDS. Here is one portion from this essay (edited for length), and I suggest reading the entire piece:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>From a narrative perspective, China is fighting this war against nCov2019 exactly like the US fought its war against North Vietnam. &#8230; They convince themselves that the people can’t handle the truth, particularly if the truth ain’t such good news. They convince themselves that they can buy enough time to win the real-world war by designing and employing a carefully constructed “communication strategy” to win the narrative-world war. That strategy proved to be a social and political disaster for the United States, as the cartoon tail (gotta get more NV casualties for Cronkite to report) ended up wagging the policy dog (send out more counterproductive search-and-destroy missions). I think exactly the same thing is happening in China. And I think the social and political repercussions will be exactly as disastrous.</p></blockquote>



<p>Personally, I am not panicking, but I’m curtailing unnecessary travel and group interactions for the next 2–3 weeks to see how things shake out, particularly given the asymptomatic “incubation period” of up to 14 days. Might that be an overreaction? Might I be misinformed? Totally. But then again, how many head-on car accidents have I had? Zero. I nonetheless put on my seatbelt every time that I drive, and we have great data on traffic fatalities. Do you have a fire extinguisher in your kitchen? Would you accept $100 to get rid of it? $1,000? I wouldn’t. As unlikely as a kitchen fire might be, the extreme <em>known</em> consequences of an out-of-control fire easily justify a fire extinguisher, even if it gathers dust forever.</p>



<p>Even though some folks think of me as a “risk-taker,” I self-identify much more as a “risk-mitigator.”</p>



<p>I dislike the unknowns on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, and—like putting on a seatbelt—it’s easy for me to mitigate a lot of downside risk until the data paint a clearer picture. <a href="https://twitter.com/MRC_Outbreak/status/1225146256558870531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Videos like this</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/naval" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naval Ravikant</a>) lead me to think that wearing an eight-point harness for a few weeks isn’t the worst idea.<br><br>I am constantly looking for such “seatbelts” in many areas of my life&#8230;</p>



<p>[The above bullet ended up going long. I just put the full version on my blog <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/02/14/some-thoughts-on-coronaviruses-and-seatbelts/?utm_source=convertkit&amp;utm_medium=convertkit&amp;utm_campaign=5bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.]</p>

This short and powerful book was first recommended to me by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tim.blog/2017/09/13/ray-dalio/" target="_blank">famed investor Ray Dalio</a>. At fewer than 150 pages, it can be digested in a few sittings and offers an impressive overview of human nature, as well as the rise and fall of civilizations. Here’s the official book description: “A concise survey of the culture and civilization of mankind, <em>The Lessons of History</em> is the result of a lifetime of research from Pulitzer Prize-winning historians Will and Ariel Durant. With their accessible compendium of philosophy and social progress, the Durants take us on a journey through history, exploring the possibilities and limitations of humanity over time.”<br><strong><br>What I’m reading and forwarding to all of my friends — (week of February 17th)<br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fortune.com/longform/psychedelic-drugs-business-mental-health/" target="_blank">Business gets ready to trip: How psychedelic drugs may revolutionize mental health care</a></strong> by Jeffrey O’Brien (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/jeffreyobrien/" target="_blank">@jeffreyobrien</a>) in <em>Fortune</em>. I don’t do much media these days, but I made a huge exception for this one, as it should be huge: 12–16 pages in the print edition, making it the largest feature in the issue.</p>



<p>It’s one of the best articles on psychedelics I’ve seen in years, and it covers a lot of important ground: business, nonprofit, scientific, and investment considerations, among others. As one friend said about the piece: “Finally, this is the article I can send my parents to explain why this is so important.” If the article resonates with you as well, please consider sharing it. It can have a large impact.</p>

<p><strong>What I’m learning more about — (week of March 16th)<br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/coyote-and-badger-hunt-together" target="_blank">Why coyotes and badgers hunt together</a></strong> by Russell McLendon (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/russmclendon?lang=en" target="_blank">@russmclendon</a>). One paragraph to give you a taste: “Each member of the hunting party has a distinct set of skills. Coyotes are nimble and quick, so they excel at chasing prey across an open prairie. Badgers are slow and awkward runners by comparison, but they’re better diggers than coyotes are, having evolved to pursue small animals in underground burrow systems. So when they hunt prairie dogs or ground squirrels on their own, badgers usually dig them up, while coyotes chase and pounce. The rodents therefore use different strategies depending which predator is after them: They often escape a digging badger by leaving their burrows to flee aboveground, and evade coyotes by running to their burrows.” <strong>I also highly recommend watching the following video: </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openspacetrust.org/blog/coyote-and-badger/" target="_blank"><strong>Coyote and Badger Caught Playing on Camera</strong></a><strong>. For some reason, I find this short clip so uplifting that I bookmarked it and often watch it when I’m feeling down or overwhelmed.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What I’m rereading — (week of March 30th) <br></strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Solve-Happy-Engineer-Your-Path/dp/1501157582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Solve for Happy: Engineer Your Path to Joy</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em>by Mo Gawdat (</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/MGawdat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>@mgawdat</strong></a><strong>). </strong>This was recommended to me by a type-A MD who runs his life at 200 mph. He is also an engineer and strongly dislikes most woo-woo thinking. He gave this book his highest recommendation. To my relief, it doesn’t require any technical background. Here is part of the description, slightly edited for space: “Mo Gawdat, Chief Business Officer at Google’s [X], applies his superior logic and problem solving skills to understand how the brain processes joy and sadness—and then he solves for happy. In 2001, Mo Gawdat realized that despite his incredible success, he was desperately unhappy. A lifelong learner, he attacked the problem as an engineer would: examining all the provable facts and scrupulously applying logic. Eventually, his countless hours of research and science proved successful, and he discovered the equation for happiness.” I’ve found it very impactful, especially his portion on “I am, therefore I think” as a more useful version of “I think, therefore I am.”</p>

James Baldwin (1924–1987) was an incredible storyteller and weaver of culture into words. He was also a tortured soul, and I’ve been fascinated by him since college. I recommend reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baldwin">his Wikipedia page</a> before the<em> Paris Review</em> interview for more context, including the fact that he was discriminated against within the civil rights movement for being gay. One aspect of James that drew me to him is that he doesn’t oversimplify in his writing; another is that he strove to uncover messiness both within and without.</p>



<p>This interview contains a lot of gold (e.g., his interactions with painter Beauford Delaney, his thoughts on writing and the self), but it’s not an easy read. The subject matter can be hard, and on top of that, you’ll need to get through language from the interviewer at the beginning like this: “We lunched on an August weekend, together with seasonal guests and his secretary.”</p>



<p>But “<a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2994/the-art-of-fiction-no-78-james-baldwin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Art of Fiction No. 78</a>” covers a mountain-load more than writing. This interview gives you a glimpse into the life and thinking of a unique human and someone who fought like hell—and struggled like hell—to change both the world and himself.<br><br><strong>What I’m reading — (week of June 8th) <br></strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Big-John-Crowley-ebook/dp/B005DB7O0U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Little, Big</em></strong></a> by John Crowley. <em>Little, Big</em> is simply one of the best novels I’ve ever read, and even that doesn’t do it justice. It is, as one reviewer put it, “mysteriously affecting.” Read a few of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Big-John-Crowley-ebook/dp/B005DB7O0U/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0/?_encoding=UTF8&#038;qid&#038;sr#customerReviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Amazon reviews here</a> to get a glimpse of what I mean. On top of that, I feel like it put me in an altered state of consciousness that often lasted for 6–12 hours, best described as a deep feeling of serenity. And yet, I’ve hesitated for weeks to put it into “5-Bullet Friday”! Why? Because I think it’ll only grab 10–20% of you. In fact, my brother gave me the paperback version in 2018, and I tried reading it three or four times over the past two years. I put it down after fewer than 50 pages in each attempt. So how’d I end up finishing it this time? <strong>This go-round, I committed to reading at least 100 pages, reading daily, and reading the Kindle version.</strong> Why? It’s partly because the prose is stunningly beautiful, but it’s unusual and requires close attention. It’s partly because there are a lot of characters introduced in the first 100 pages, and you need to keep them straight, which is why I also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CAtQO8InRVX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a pic of a family tree</a> (the last of the three photos in the post) to help everyone out. Last, author John Crowley uses exquisite and poetic vocabulary, but I needed the Kindle built-in dictionary quite a lot (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/borborygmus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>borborygmus</em></a>, anyone?). It all sounds like a lot of work, and—guess what?—it <em>is</em> a lot of work. But hot damn, the payoff is just so, so delicious that it’s hard to describe. If you try it, don’t say I didn’t warn you. 8 out of 10 of you will think I’ve lost my mind. But 2 out of 10 will find this tale of hyperreality, unreality, concrete jungles, fairy tales, and dreams to be nearly magical in its effects. This book is special.</p>

Here is one of my favorite portions:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>[INTERVIEWER:]</strong></p><p>Why then do psychedelics seem to do better in the treatment of addictions than conventional treatments?</p><p><strong>[DR. SESSA:]</strong></p><p>Because underlying addiction, and many if not most chronic mental disorders, is rigidity. Stuck rigid mental narratives about self and the world, which arise early in life as a result of early experiences, in other words, the very core building blocks of our personality, which stay with us for life. The majority of mental health treatments, and certainly all the medicines we use, like SSRIs, don’t do anything to those narratives, they just paper over the cracks and treat the overlying symptoms. In my experience, psychedelics are the best new form of pharmacology that we’ve come across that has the potential to actually tackle those narratives and allows people to build them up in a new, more positive way.</p></blockquote>

This is a great piece with some notable and surprising names. That said, the headline doesn’t capture the most important part to me: ~2,500 donors participated, in amounts ranging from one dollar to $5 million, to raise the $30 million needed to complete clinical trials for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for trauma/PTSD. My sincerest thanks to each and every one of you who helped make this happen!

This is one of the best books about non-fiction writing that I’ve ever read. Be forewarned that it skips the hand-wavy platitudes and gets straight to the nitty-gritty details, as all McPheesian stories do. From the official description: “<em>Draft No. 4 </em>is a master class on the writer’s craft. In a series of playful, expertly wrought essays, John McPhee shares insights he has gathered over his career and has refined while teaching at Princeton University, where he has nurtured some of the most esteemed writers of recent decades. McPhee offers definitive guidance in the decisions regarding arrangement, diction, and tone that shape nonfiction pieces, and he presents extracts from his work, subjecting them to wry scrutiny. The result is a vivid depiction of the writing process, from reporting to drafting to revising―and revising, and revising.”<br><br><strong>What I’m reading and definitely needing this week — (week of September 21st) <br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dailystoic.com/stoic-leader-traits/" target="_blank">9 Common Traits in the Lives of Stoic Leaders</a> </strong>by Stephen Hanselman (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/SteveHanselman" target="_blank">@SteveHanselman</a>).</p>

<p><strong>What I’m reading — (week of November 2nd) <br></strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joyful-Wisdom-Embracing-Finding-Freedom/dp/0307407802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Joyful Wisdom: Embracing Change and Finding Freedom</em></strong></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongey_Mingyur_Rinpoche">Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche</a>. This book was first recommended to me by the phenom that is <a href="https://tim.blog/2019/08/16/safi-bahcall/?utm_source=convertkit&amp;utm_medium=convertkit&amp;utm_campaign=5bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Safi Bahcall</a>, a former physicist and founder of a publicly-traded biotech company, who also knows hypnotism and a dozen other fields inside and out. It took me more than a year to dig into <em>Joyful Wisdom</em>, as I was turned off by the title. I expected another rinse and repeat of the usual Buddhist bag o’ tricks, which have never quite clicked for me. Much to my surprise, I quickly found insights, analogies, and practices that *did* stick in the first 100 pages.</p>



<p><strong>What I’m reading — (week of November 9th) <br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/opinion/sunday/cyrus-habib-jesuit.html" target="_blank">Politician Cyrus Habib Leaves Office to Join the Jesuits</a></strong> (<em>New York Times </em>— <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes">@nytimes</a>). Have you ever fantasized about walking off and leaving it all behind? This is the amazing story of one man, on track for ever-growing prestige and power, who did just that.

This remains one of my favorite pieces ever published by <em>WIRED</em>. I printed it out more than a year ago and reread it often, continuing to highlight new things. If you feel overwhelmed by the noise, or if you simply fantasize about being a stranger in a strange land, this is a wonderful transporter. Told through the lens of an ultra-marathon walk through Japan, Craig’s story contains a lot of gems, including paragraphs like these:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I have configured servers, written code, built web pages, helped design products used by millions of people. I am firmly in the camp that believes technology is generally bending the world in a positive direction. Yet, for me, Twitter foments neurosis, Facebook sadness, Google News a sense of foreboding. Instagram turns me covetous. All of them make me want to do it—whatever “it” may be—for the likes, the comments. I can’t help but feel that I am the worst version of myself, being performative on a very short, very depressing timeline. A timeline of seconds.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>In the context of a walk like this, “boredom” is a goal, the antipode of mindless connectivity, constant stimulation, anger and dissatisfaction. I put “boredom” in quotes because the boredom I’m talking about fosters a heightened sense of presence. To be “bored” is to be free of distraction.</p></blockquote>



<p><br><strong>What I’m reading — (week of November 23rd) <br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://paulgraham.com/think.html" target="_blank">How to Think for Yourself</a></strong> by <a href="http://paulgraham.com/index.html">Paul Graham</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/paulg">@paulg</a>). I have recommended many of Paul’s essays over the years, including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/disc.html" target="_blank">The Risk of Discovery</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/kids.html" target="_blank">Having Kids</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html" target="_blank">Keep Your Identity Small</a>, and, perhaps more than any other, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank">Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule</a>. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://paulgraham.com/think.html" target="_blank">How to Think for Yourself</a> is a fabulous new addition to the list. Here’s one of my favorite excerpts from it: “Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later turn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is not to find flaws in the things you’re told, but to find the new ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones.”<br><br><strong>What I’m reading (longer but easy) — (week of December 7th)<br></strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tales-Dervishes-Teaching-Stories-Masters-Thousand/dp/0140193588" target="_blank"><strong><em>Tales of the Dervishes: Teaching-Stories of the Sufi Masters over the Past Thousand Years</em></strong></a><strong>. </strong>Sometimes I learn, and absorb usable truths, best through time-tested fiction. Most stories in this book are only 1–5 pages long. Description: “Dervish tales are more than fable, legend, or folklore. For centuries, dervish masters have instructed their disciples by means of these teaching stories, which are said to increase perception and knowledge and provide a better understanding of man and the world. … Idries Shah spent many years traveling through three continents to collect and compare oral versions of these remarkable stories. This anthology…contains stories drawn from the repertories of dervish masters over a period of more than a thousand years.”<br><br><strong>What I’m rereading (short) — (week of December 7th)<br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/business/cell-phone-addiction.html" target="_blank">Do Not Disturb: How I Ditched My Phone and Unbroke My Brain</a></strong> by Kevin Roose (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose" target="_blank">@kevinroose</a>) for the<em> New York Times</em>.<br><br><strong>Article I’m revisiting — (week of December 21st) <br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26524600/secret-team-dinners-built-spurs-dynasty" target="_blank">Michelin restaurants and fabulous wines: Inside the secret team dinners that have built the Spurs’ dynasty</a> (</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/espn"><strong>@espn</strong></a><strong>).</strong> This piece is FANTASTIC. It is wonderfully written and full of takeaways if you read carefully. Hat tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/bakerlink">@bakerlink</a> for the recommendation. Here’s a short teaser from the beginning:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As much as [Coach] Popovich knows about hoops, he really knows food and wine. “I don’t know that he doesn’t know more about wine than he does about basketball,” former Spurs assistant coach P.J. Carlesimo says. Popovich scouts restaurants and wine lists as obsessively as he might any opponent. Before games, in his office, he can be found watching the Food Network. Sommeliers and restaurateurs claim to owe their careers to the man.… As absurd as it seems, one of the greatest basketball coaches in history might be more revered in the culinary world.</p></blockquote>



<p>Read the whole thing, as the ending is killer. Coach Popovich has been on my mind as a possible podcast guest for years. This piece just reinforces the interest, but I know how much he dislikes most media. Perhaps some day…</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are locking up these parts of us that are so wonderful and have so many talents&#8230; when they&#8217;re not locked up and when they&#8217;re not stuck in the past.</p><cite>— Richard Schwartz</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Richard Schwartz</strong>&nbsp;is on the faculty of the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.</p>



<p>He began his career as a family therapist and an academic at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he discovered that family therapy alone did not achieve full symptom relief. In asking patients why, he learned that they were plagued by what they called “parts.” These patients became his teachers as they described how their parts formed networks of inner relationships that resembled the families he had been working with. He also found that as they focused on and, thereby, separated from their parts, they would shift into a state characterized by qualities like curiosity, calm, confidence, and compassion. He called that inner essence the Self and was amazed to find it even in severely diagnosed and traumatized patients. From these explorations, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ifs-institute.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Internal Family Systems</strong></a> (IFS) model was born in the early 1980s.</p>



<p>IFS is now evidence based and has become a widely used form of psychotherapy, particularly with trauma. It provides a non-pathologizing, optimistic, and empowering perspective and a practical and effective set of techniques for working with individuals, couples, families, and—more recently—corporations and classrooms.</p>

<h3>SHOW NOTES</h3>



<ul><li>After <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/09/14/how-to-heal-trauma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing my story of childhood abuse</a> with the world, what has the aftermath been like? [08:24]</li><li>As a freshly graduated family therapist in the early &#8217;80s, Richard shares how he first encountered the concept of &#8220;parts&#8221; that became foundational to IFS. [15:17]</li><li>I confess my initial resistance to IFS and how seeing its non-pathologizing methods put into action changed my opinion, and Richard speaks to why diverging from traditional therapy can be a hard sell. [22:34]</li><li>Richard gives us a brief conceptual overview of IFS so we can understand the context of terms like &#8220;parts&#8221; and &#8220;exiles&#8221; and &#8220;firefighters.&#8221; [29:03]</li><li>A note on how IFS prompts self-discovery in a way that some have only found through the use of psychedelics. [37:22]</li><li>For the sake of demonstration, Richard takes me through an IFS session to explore how I might move from a place of anxiety and fear to a place of trust and faith by addressing and getting to know the parts of me that stoke that anxiety and fear rather than trying to dismiss them. [39:54]</li><li>A post-game analysis of what we just experienced together &#8212; how becoming a compassionate witness to these traumatically burdened parts of ourselves and giving them a voice fosters much-needed self-empathy for the healing process to truly begin. [1:06:13]</li><li>How parts work can be applied to someone going through suicidal ideation. [1:09:48]</li><li>As psychologist Carl Rogers once said, &#8220;The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I change.&#8221; How does this relate to the IFS model, and what&#8217;s the step after this acceptance? [1:16:08]</li><li>While psychedelic experiences have proven therapeutically helpful for a number of issues including PTSD, they&#8217;re not suitable for everyone. But might it possible for IFS to help a prospective patient prepare for a psychedelic experience? What are the potential dangers? [1:17:31]</li><li>How can someone make IFS a daily practice? Richard gives us an example from his own life that took place right before this interview, and shares what a good check-in might look like. [1:23:42]</li><li>Couples in quarantine over the past year may have experienced what IFS would call a &#8220;protector war.&#8221; What is this and how would Richard help resolve it? [1:27:49]</li><li>What are trailheads, and how can they lead us toward a breakthrough? [1:34:20]</li><li>Richard&#8217;s recommended resources for someone looking to further explore IFS (these can be found at the top of the selected links above). [1:36:18]</li><li>Parting thoughts. [1:39:19]</li></ul>
